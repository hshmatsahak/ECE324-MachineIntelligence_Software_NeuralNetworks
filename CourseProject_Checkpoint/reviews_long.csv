"[""Chinatown is flush with Chinese restaurants densely packed on every block - most of which, in my opinion at least, have adapted strongly to the American palate to accommodate the throngs of tourists that frequent the area. In that context, I was very pleasantly surprised with my meal at Bubor Cha Cha last week - \xa0quite authentic and generally delicious (albeit a bit unevenly across the board).We started with a bowl of egg drop soup and a plate of steamed dumplings to start. Soup was so-so (the colour a bit odd, to be honest, and overall too sweet) and the dumplings were fine but certainly nothing special.Fortunately, the meal only got (much) better from there. The remaining dishes we ordered - mapo tofu, kung pao chicken, stir fried string beans, and a sliced fish with diced chili peppers - were very yummy and definitely exceeded my expectations.The fish in particular was fantastic - juicy, tender, and extremely flavourful (I only wished it was a bit spicier) - would highly recommend! The tofu and the chicken dishes were both quite tasty too, with a good savoury profile without being too heavy. String beans were cooked well with a nice seasoning, complementing the other dishes well with its lighter flavours.Overall, a great meal (perhaps skip some of the appetisers), and the final cheque came out to be lower than expected. I'll be back for more soon!"", 'Wanted to find somewhere for a quick, reasonable meal when in Boston for the weekend.All the hotpot places over crowded, overpriced, noisy and two hour waits.Dropped into here - seated immediately, served soon after, and had a great meal.Excellent hot & sour soup.And enjoyed the mains also - tasty, plentiful & cooked to order.Great service also.Would recommend!', ""Bustling joint in Chinatown, mainly Asian clientele so looked authentic, waitresses literally running from table to table. Steamed shrimp dumplings were wonderful, like you'd get at a top dim sum restaurant. Eggplant with string beans and fried tofu were okay except the eggplant had been mercilessly salted to dehydrate them but the crunchy salt crystals were never washed off, so that was suboptimal. Fish with onions and ginger was breaded with way too eggy batter. We probably ordered poorly. Overall we had fun and ate well, but I'll try a different C-town spot next time."", ""Food came out quickly and was hot! The service was great. I think for a first time, the Xiang's Sweet and Spicy Crispy Chicken is a good choice. The chicken isn't too spicy at all but it is VERY CRISPY! If you want to bring balance to your meal, I suggest getting the pea shoots! I would come back here to try something else as it was a very enjoyable time."", 'Good food... we ordered shrimp fried rice and sweet and sour shrimp both delicious but the fried rice could use some more flavor', ""I haven't come here for years and I was definitely pleasantly surprised! I last came here for dim sum, and recently I came here for dinner and I really liked it!Like the rest of Chinatown, street parking only or parking further and walk in :) Bubor Chacha is in the middle of Chinatown. The food came out super fast and fresh, this is the perfect place for dinner with a bit of a kick in most of your dishes! my friends and I came here and did a family style dinner. The waitresses were friendly and great with helping us decide between a couple dishes! I love how everything was spicy but you can still really taste the flavors :) I will definitely recommend this place and I've been craving to come back here! Everything here is portioned well and I can't get over how flavorful each dish was!100% recommend grabbing dinner here and finish off with bubble tea ;)"", 'Yums! Should definitely try this gem in Chinatown. Super short wait and friendly staff.', ""3rd times the charm? \xa0This location with the same name seem to have had a few iterations. \xa0The last two time we were there (pre-pandemic), there was no service: waited for 10-15min, either no water, no menu, and/or no waiter to take order.This time we got water and they do the QR code menu, but the water tastes somewhat like reverse osmosis water and the waitress insisted that we order through her instead of the app... from the QR code. \xa0The water didn't taste like tap, filtered tap, or bottle water... seems like reverse osmosis water stored in a questionable vessel. \xa0For the service with a biased history: 2 stars.As for the food, easily 4 stars! \xa0The dishes are simple yet not really, there are different notes of flavors, textured mouth feels to the various dishes. \xa0What should savory tastes savory, what should be crispy are crispy, what should be sweet, tastes sweet. \xa0What should be spicy are spicy. \xa0Each one is not overbearing and work well together. \xa0Really good food, now if they could get their operations to go more smoothly, that would be great."", 'shit service and a total mess. Was asked to wait for 15 minutes for a table ended up with waiting for 45 minute and still no table. The lady was promised for giving us the next available and always someone else cut in and take that. Will never come up.', ""Always wanted to try this place but never been and I can't believe I have not come sooner! Ordered a variety of items off the menu to share family style, which I would recommend!1. Chicken soup- tasted pretty okay, with a strong taste of sesame oil, which I think is what kind of ruined it for me. I miss the clean taste of Chinese soup. I probably wouldn't order this again.2. Sweet and Sour fish fillet- my favorite dish of the tonight! Perfect crunchy, sweet, and sour. Even though it only comes with 2 large pieces, you can split it up into 6 very filling portions. 3. Spicy fish fillet- the presentation of this itself deserves 5 stars! We were hesitant to order this because we had already ordered the sweet and sour fish, but I'm so glad we did! The fish was so flavorful and tender.4. Bok Choy- nothing too special about this, we just wanted some vegetables to balance out the meats5. Sour Cabbage- a very humble dish, but one that always hits the spot! The delicate balance of black vinegar used in this provides an addicting taste that leaves you wanting more. 6. Spicy Intestine in Pot- if you're a fan of grilled meats and spice, this is the dish for you! It is jam packed of bold flavors. Only downside is that the ratio of meat to garnishes was way off :( 7. Fried Man Tou- a childhood indulgence that we simply could not miss! The perfectly fried man tou is akin to a warm beignet and dipping it in the condensed milk made the most perfect bite!Side notes: they do charge a pretty hefty price for rice which was the one thing that bugged me considered most places offer rice as an accompaniment to these dishes.All in all a very delicious experience and I can't wait to come back to try other items!""]",negative
"[""Best place for macarons in Austin, and everything else I've tried is good too. \xa0I also very much appreciate that they support good causes."", ""Popped in on a Sunday mid-day and they still had a nice selection of pastries. The location is a sweet little house with parking in the back that opens back up to the street so you can easily get out.We tried a chocolate croissant and a beignet - very reasonable priced for a pastry shop! The chocolate croissant had 2 lines of chocolate all the way down and a nice crunch on the ends. Could have been a bit flakier, but a definite step above like a Starbucks one. The beignet was good - it's hard to make them taste as good if they're not straight out of the fryer. We will be back to try more of their items!"", 'On vacation and saw the mural and saw this cute place. Walked in to not be greeted by the gentleman behind the counter. We were the only people in there and he acted as if we were a bother. Ordered some over priced macaroons that were hard and dry - not how they are supposed to be. Plenty of places in Austin to have a sweet treat without rude and lack of taste. Avoid this place', ""Nice spot for coffee and a dessert; they have a shaded patio outside and are right off of 1st street so you can people watch a bit as they go to the famous Austin sign. They also have a drive-through if you don't want to go inside. They have a pretty good selection of different kinds of French pastries, including beignets, which we were excited about since we're going to NOLA soon. The people were cool and friendly, quick, and made a nice special coffee, and they have plenty of macrons, that were quite good; I'm not usually a big fan of them but they had nice flavor and weren't too sweet."", ""They had a sign on the door stating they are closed until 3pm due to repairs. A group of people were sitting outside. They saw us outside but at 3pm nothing happened. I went up to the door to ask if they are open and they let us in. It would have been nice if they had at least come out and acknowledged that we sat and waited. Absolutely no customer service and the maroons were stale tasting as if they were old. The outside is cute. Sort of reminds you of Alice And Wonderland's tea party. The inside could use some tidying up. They didn't have many options and I'm not sure if that was due to repairs. I plan to give it another try but I do hope it's better."", ""What a delicious find in this trip to austin!! Was looking for a cronut and instead found this place with a CroBrio.... omg how is this legal??! Granted it is very sweet but the filling was so spectacular- and plentiful! I loved it! Was big enough to share!! Also the location is right next to the famous Austin mural so if you go there you have an instagrammable spot right away... not to mention that the patisserie itself is suuuuper pink and cute!Come and get them: next time I'll make sure to try their croissants too!"", ""the cutest place ever! We were visiting and looking for the Austin sign as tourists and this cute place was next door. We went in to use the bathroom and then we saw MACAROONS! My daughters favorite dessert and I could tell they were homemade so we definitely had to buy some! We got lavender, matcha, confetti and lemon. The expert said that they were the best she's ever had! We loved them as well. The employee was incredibly kind too! Super cool vibe! We will be back to visit next time we are in Austin!"", ""Sublime. From the aesthetic to the execution of the fresh Mille Feuille, you won't be disappointed. Definitely get the Mille Feuille. The s'mores tart is rich so make sure to grab a coffee if you're going to get it. So glad I found this place."", ""Love, love, loved this lil coffee shop. All thanks to cool painted Austin mural/post card.It's a few steps away from the landmark. It looks like it was an old house converted into a coffeehouse/dessert place.The coffee is of course delicious, and the desserts looked scrumptious. We ordered some macaroons and were not disappointed.My only complaint was that I wanted a French press coffee but it was shut down for the day when we visited. Besides that we had a great time.Tourist tip bonus! Check out the bathroom, it has a funny and cute mural about unicorns."", ""I ordered an iced chai latte, vanilla latte, and a cream puff at both of their locations. Honestly, their coffee is pretty mediocre. They don't use house-made syrup, so everything tastes generic. Their employees are really nice, which I appreciate. I wasn't the biggest fan of my cream puff, either. It was almost a bit too hard and sweet. It's definitely a really cute pastry shop, but I personally wasn't a fan. Perhaps I should be judging more on their pastries than on their actual coffee, but my two separate visits did not impress me.""]",positive
"[""I started looking this place up on yelp and google maps because I needed to pick up emergency cupcakes between work and a birthday get together on Hawthorne. After reading the Yelp reviews, I knew I had to go check it out cupcakes or not! \xa0This is the place on Glisan with the Fresh Bread sign. I stopped in yesterday and am so glad i did! \xa0I bought a loaf of the dark rye, and some of the salmon from the deli case. I assume it's cold smoked salmon? I don't know but it's AMAZING. The dark rye is incredible also - no seeds, and it's not all sugary sweet like some breads. NEXT TIME I'm going for the deli case with its 4 kinds of mushroom salads, shredded carrot salad, and beets. AND a huge Russian pastry. They were out of pireogies (sp?) this time around alas. \xa0If you're in the n'hood go get some bread. They have several different kinds including a white and light rye. No additives. and at $3 - $4 a loaf not a bad deal!Also they have like 10 different types of farmer cheese, all manner of Eastern European cheeses, sausages, health and beauty stuff, candy, chocolate, pastries, cakes, beautiful samovars and even ice cream bars in a bright, tidy, cheerful store."", ""Been here several times. Any time I have used a debit card there, I get a notification a few days later from my bank that my account has been breached, and I have to get a new debit card every single time that I use it there. I go with a friend and this has happened three times to him too. So, there is something fishy going on here. I have gone with cash since the third time I had to get a new card. They have some good stuff. In spite of reviews, I haven't noticed anything remotely like friendliness there. I don't expect Russians to be friendly, however. That is an American thing, not a Russian thing and it doesn't bother me. Much of the food that is supposed to be hot, is left to set out uncovered and at room temperature. They have great pastries with chicken and cabbage that are inexpensive. They keep them in a donut case, and I am sure they are supposed to be kept at a certain temperature, since it's chicken. I get a few every time, and have not been sick yet. They have a lot of things you can't find anywhere else. I like to go there for that reason. I suggest you use cash, and be aware that you could be buying food that isn't properly stored, if you get the premade stuff. I would give it 4 stars, in spite of the poor food handling, but the fact that they appear to steal your credit and debit card numbers takes a star off."", 'Staff does not wear masks. Cashier licked her fingers, did not sanitize and continued to check out a customer. Absolutely disgusting.', ""Staff members don't wear masks, including the owner. Major potential for for covid spread here. A shame they don't respect their customers or the Governor enough to comply with basic public health measures.

I bought borsch and it was totally without meat, by restorant price. If you don't know how to make borsch please don't sell it. Also got Russian traditonal salad have no idea how thay made it so bad. There is no way to do it in a bad way, but they did. But they refund me money for salad, and cashier was really care about situation."", ""This used to be our favorite neighborhood grocery store. Wonderful owner and service. This morning when I walked into the store, all the employees were unmasked. In the store there was also a 5, 6 year old unmasked that sneezed around the food. I was shocked by the fact that everyone was unmasked but I thought they will put on the mask when I approach the counter. That wasn't the case. The woman who approached the counter to check out was unmasked and remained unmasked. I was so confused with the fact that she is unmasked that I forgot I have the option to leave my groceries and walk out as soon as I realized that she is going to be unmasked two feet away from me, indoor, with a sneezing child around. I really regret not walking out. I don't know if the store changed the owner (it looks and feels very different inside than pre Covid), but if a business has a large sign on the door asking customers to wear a mask, then the employees should do the same. What a scary experience!"", 'OMG what a rip off. Some food even in LA cost cheaper than here. 1 pound of Russian dumplings cost $10.99 when I buy in LA for $4.99. Be AWARE cookies, candies were expired! Some of them are expired so one has to check everything what you are buying. Some things are so overpriced that I feel ripped off. Bakery was out of goodies so I was upset about that too!', ""I used to work in the Montavilla area and would head up to the Fred Meyer on occasion when heading home. So I'd pass NE Glisen on 102nd every so often. I'd see the Cyrillic lettering but not know what this place was, well I decided to find out. A Russian bakery!!! Score!One of the first things I saw were the pastries up front and towards the back of the place, the bread. Russian rye bread is where I went right to and grabbed a fresh loaf. $3.49 for the loaf and no caraway seeds. I'll admit, I'm actually starting to use caraway in some of my cooking and I do like it in the bread now, but this had no seeds and I was fine with that. I browsed around and found some chocolate cookies to purchase and at the counter I found a cherry danish type pastry that was HUGE. It was a good thing there were other customers in the store because the woman at the counter was Russian and did not speak a lot of English. So I guess pointing is the way to go.The store is for the Russian population around here primarily. I'm learning it is a rather large group. There were plenty of goods from the motherland and even a few I'd venture to try in the future. They have a deli area with meats and fish and I'd be up for trying some of those options as well.I will make it back soon. Enjoy."", ""A wonderful little shop/bakery. I didn't have a lot of time but I was hankering for something warm and sweet and flaky. This place fit the bill with a number of options. I ended up with a cherry filled, glazed pastry that was AMAZING! Real Stewed Cherry filling and not something out of a can. While I was there, i was able to grab a few retail items that you can only find in European markets. They also have a small selection of European meats and cheeses. A great little market, incredibly clean and quiet. Not a bustling market so easy to get in and out. I think next time I'll grab a few more pastries!""]",negative

The standards Seoul Topokki had really good texture, soft and chewy throughout, but the sauce was a bit monolithic; on the one hand too sweet, and yet not nuanced enough in the spicy flavoring. Also could use a bit more variety in the accoutrements.The seafood jigae (for 2 people) was decently on a number of fronts. Some of the large squid that was carefully packed for takeout was tough, though some was nice and delicately soft. The clams were great, but the mussels were alternately dry, and moist. The flavoring of the broth was also too sweet in general.The best was the vegetable pancake - nicely fried on both sides, with delicate cuts of purple cabbage and carrot interspersed in the pancake. If doing takeout, it's nice to fry it up gently on both sides for added crispness."", ""I'm conflicted.For what it was, this place was fine.

We ordered one of the combos that included the tteokbokki, kimbap, and soup.Like in a previous review, the rice cakes in the tteokbokki do get quite firm as it cools down and they need to find a better way to retain the heat with the dish itself. The kimbap was good and tasted pretty authentic. It was also pretty large with a good portion size. The soup was underwhelming, but it did hit the spot at the time.Our waiter was very friendly and the service was quick, so no complaints there. The restaurant itself is very clean.

The estimated wait time for me was about 20-30 minutes. I ended up waiting closer to 50 minutes for my order. I did, however, enjoy the savory/sweet mix of flavors with this dish.One thing I am quite picky about is the temperature of my food. I didn't anticipate this waffle to be on the lukewarm/cold side.

Highly recommend!! The Chicken Waffle sandwich ($10.5) \xa0was also good and came with fried chicken, tomato, lettuce, and a spicy aioli. The chicken was very moist and the aioli was delicious. Overall, I'd recommend this place for solid breakfast/lunch food. There are tons of options on the menu to pick from, and both the ones we picked were yummy.

I decided to try something new and get the chive and onion potato pancakes. They were ok? The texture threw me off very mushy but the flavor was good. The apple sauce side was just regular apple sauce so always a fan. I also got 1 biscuit and a side gravy which was the star of the show. Their biscuits are made in house and you can definitely taste the difference, the gravy was also amazing and full of flavor. To drink I got the fresh squeezed orange juice which was SO GOOD .

The creamy lemon chicken was not as lemony as I would have expected but nonetheless still very tender juicy and flavorful... now onto the villain... the vegetables were very bland and unseasoned could have used a few more minutes grilling or frying and loads more seasonings like garlic powder onion powder Lawrys and paprika.

I would've preferred honey butter if known it would've been regular butter but that's on me for not asking... the corn bread was delicious with the butter.

They have a massive menu and it's nearly impossible to cook every item well, to perfection. \xa0So I would recommend to be selective and think about which items they do well and sell a lot of. It's a humble diner, so don't expect anything fancy and exceptional but still, they do offer great food."", ""This is our second visit, and while the first visit was fine....the second was anything but. Disclaimer: I am not a rude customer nor would I ever be confrontational with a service worker as it really is a terrible thing to do. The server completely ignored everything we said to them. We corrected them multiple times and somehow they still didn't get the order right. They didn't know the menu and when corrected just brushed it off. When attempting to rectify the issue they kept returning with half of what we asked. They eventually stopped bringing what we originally asked for in the first place. I asked for two strips of bacon and when bringing it dropped one strip on the floor. They proceed to turn around and leave the bacon on the floor to get another piece. I had to pick it up off of the floor myself. My significant other ordered blueberry pancakes and was brought buttermilk. He asked nicely for some compote and they had to be reminded twice. Also I paid 13$ for a ham and cheese waffle. We are talking eggo thickness. For that price I expect belgian style. The waffle was amazing, the bacon was bacon, and the pancakes were not what we wanted but we're ok. I think we will just stick with Shari's next time. We met the owner last time and he was very nice...but this server just wasn't doing it for me."", '""Fluffy and tasty"" is the description. Does this look like fluffy pancakes? The sidewalk outside is fluffier than these pancakes. A ""Pancake House"" serving this kind of pancakes should really be ashamed of themselves. 2 bites in to a full order and it\'s going into the trash. Wife got the ""Chocolate chip pancakes"" and she received more flat, flavorless pancakes with a few chocolate chips placed on top. Nothing was baked in as the description. I could have done that myself & saved a $4 mark up above a regular pancake order.Please do yourself a favor & avoid the disappointment - Black Bear Diner is up the street. They have ""real"" pancakes.']",negative

However, we were seated immediately with a server greeting us soon after. The menu is seasonal and fresh sticking with the ""true food"" theme. Prices however... are hefty (but probably about the same as other Buckhead restaurants). We split a panini and turkey burger which was amazing.

On my last visit I ordered the Korean noodle bowl which turned out to be pretty spicy. It didn't indicate that anywhere on the menu so that was upsetting.

Here, I really didn't feel the same, as the service started out good, yet it when became a little busier it decreased.The Herb Hummus was good per usual. I haven't been to TFK since January 2020, so I took advantage of their new Vegan Double Cheeseburger, where I was not disappointed. The portobello, walnut, beet, & kuzu patty was a different combination, yet tasty. The pickled onions & housemade Vegenaise Remoulade rounded out the Vegan concept. My Niece's Turkey Burger was a little dry as with my Grand Nephew's Burger. Definitely will pass on the Watermelon Lemonade as it lacked the normal sweet melon aspect. As a patio lover, the layout & covering work. However, the patio's furniture was disgusting. You can feel the coils when sitting down in addition to the dirty, dingy coverings. I don't recall TFK prices being this steep, as we didn't get the bang for the bucks. More importantly, we are still amongst a Pandemic, the lack of cleaning & sanitizing was too evident during our lunch. We had to ask for new dishes & ultimately ended up using plastic utensils. One & done."", 'Vibe: Casual Really good food but that\'s about it. This place is extremely difficult to get to and there is no parking. This restaurant, it\'s unfortunate that it is in the center of the busiest mall and Atlanta.I would give this place four stars maybe at a different location. I appreciate that it is a chain restaurant. I will say everything here is so fresh. You can see from any point or table in the restaurant the kitchen in the back that is basically an open floor plan. They make homemade juices and drinks that are flavorful and healthy.My personal favorite here is the ancient grains bowl with tofu. Yes, everything on the menu is healthy but they also offer pizza and other non-traditional ""healthy"" foods. Don\'t miss the truffle edamame dumplings!!!! Their outdoor patio is great but there are also some cool booths inside. I\'m giving this place three stars because the food is so worth it but I always leave and enter feeling stressed out. Getting there is exhausting and then being vocal to the staff about my needs and wants is tiring and then by the time you get home you wish you never went out. Not only is it a hassle to get all the way seated here, but they are horrible at following through on Uber eats or GrubHub orders as well.The drivers have to park and walk into the restaurant or something?? Regardless, anytime I\'ve ordered delivery from here it takes X2 the amount of time estimated.', ""Good vegan friendly place and great cocktails! I came here for brunch and got the vegan double cheeseburger. Personally, I'm not a big fan of huge portion sizes and this was just that. I got the kale salad and my boyfriend got the sweet potatoes.

The patty in the burger could use some more flavor but you could definitely tell that the ingredients were fresh.""]",positive
"[""First time at DD with R and friends Margaret and Dan. It was on my list since it got a not bad write up in Knife & Fork about a year ago and was in a good location not far for any of us.Despite the bad reviews here on Yelp, we did not think the food was bad or expensive. While it was a bit on the salty side, it's also that the flavors were thick, but they were tasty. We started with chicken dumplings which are steamed and then pan seared, the small variety with medium thick skin - very nice. Then we shared: salt and pepper squid, mapo tofu with pork, double cooked pork and wok eggplant. The mapo tofu is not that spicy but you can request to make it spicier - it was different than authentic Sichuan mapo tofu, but tasty in its own thick, chunky way (not watery). I liked the double cooked pork - it had a really interesting texture and the flavor soaked in nicely. It also had plenty of baby bok choi and scallion - providing us a bit of green, which was a nice match with our non-greens dishes. The eggplant was soft and simple and went down easy. Not fancy, but familiar if you've eaten this dish in other Chinese restaurants millions of times. Comforting.I'm not sure what the fuss is about the cost. We didn't get drinks so there's that, but it only came to about $17 per person including a standard tip. We enjoyed the laid back setting - don't go expecting a fancy place, it's not. It was very uncrowded - a quiet Wednesday night - and we were able to linger and enjoy a nice leisurely meal. Sometimes that's what you want, more than trendy, loud and happening."", 'I\'ve got to agree with the other mediocre reviews that Double Dragon has received. I was here on a Wednesday night so we were seated quickly. They have a large space, but it still manages to feel crowded. I think it\'s because the bar takes up a lot of space and you have to shuffle by the bar stools to get to the booths.The menu is probably best described as take out American Chinese done fresh. That\'s a good concept, but the food itself is all fairly bland. None of the sauces had much flavor beyond ""salty"" and ""chili oil."" I know that my expectations for Chinese take out is shaped by places that specialize in cheap ingredients and MSG, but I guess I prefer that. As the saying goes, ""Sometimes things that are expensive are worse."" They use dark meat chicken which would be fine if the flavors were better, but the bad texture of dark meat bits are more pronounced when served in bland sauce. My partner had the beef fried rice and the beef had so much fat on it that he basically just picked all the meat out because every bite was rubbery. Fat brings flavor but large chunks of solid fat are gross.The service is fine and the the staff are friendly, but the food isn\'t worth coming here.', 'If you haven\'t tried this place, you should! Decided to walk over on a cold and rainy Saturday evening and try this newest-ish offering in our n\'hood. Walked in the doors at 7 pm and was seated right away. \xa0The menu is straight-forward and has great options, but isn\'t overwhelming. If you\'re expecting oily, greasy, overly salty food-not your jam. It is obvious that all their meat and veggies are fresh (or as the board and menu touted-locally sourced). We had chicken dumplings to start-pan fried but not dripping with greasy oil. Just right. The packets of delight were stuffed \xa0(generously so) with chicken and some scallions. Hubs ordered Mongolian chicken and I had the pepper beef. Automatically we could see the difference. The sauce for the beef was brown and smoky-could taste the peppercorn. Not super salty but definitely seasoned. The Mongolian chicken had a lighter sauce, and you could taste the tiniest hint of honey. The onions and bellpeppers in both were sauteed to perfection. You can order their house-made spicy grainy mustard and chili oil if you want to add heat or other flavors to the food, but it felt so balanced and fresh that we tasted the sauces after eating most of our meals.Inside is also a cute soft serve ice cream bar. We split a kid sized chocolate with Oreo and ground pistachio. Again, generously filled cup with lots of toppings. Space was clean, uncluttered, and not noisy with comfortable seating. They also have an old school arcade Double Dragon that you could play for free! Is this more expensive than ""Chinese-American"" take-out? Yes, but it\'s definitely a great alternative. We left feeling full, satisfied, not bloated, and happy. \xa0Service staff was friendly, attentive, and helpful. We will definitely be coming back for more delicious eats.', ""Didn't read the reviews and ordered takeout. Absolutely terrible. Ordered Kung Pao chicken, the taste was salty only, nothing like Kung Pao. Also ordered twice cooked pork, the pork was thick slices and not twice cooked. Taste was similar to that of Kung Pao chicken - I suspect they used the same sauce. Fried rice with mushroom was oily and tastes very plain. Only about 5 slices of mushroom in total. The most absurd thing is, pork dumplings cost $8 and there are only 4 pieces! I've never seen this price at any restaurant in Atlanta. Will not be coming back again and I recommend everyone to stay away from this place."", 'Definitely not your typical American Chinese food restaurant. They have integrated their own flavors into the dishes. What I tried:1) Wontons in Aromatic Chili Oil: these are actually pretty good. Nice meat to wrapper ratio. The chili oil adds a nice roasted spicy flavor to the wonton. Meat is flavorful and breaks apart as you bite into it.2) Egg Drop Soup: the soup is very different from what you will get at a ""normal"" Chinese restaurant. There are a lot more complex flavors in the soup and has a stronger, I want to say, chicken flavor. There is a lot of salt in the soup. Overall, the soup was decent, but not really what I was expecting.3) General Tso\'s Chicken: the chicken does not have that crunchy, oily texture that you might be expecting from a Chinese restaurant. The chicken does taste fresh and has good flavor. The chicken is moist and not dry as you might expect. The sauce tastes like your traditional General\'s chicken sauce.I don\'t think that I would recommend the place to others that are looking for American Chinese takeout food, but this may be a decent alternative for people looking for more ""healthy"" Chinese food. The ingredients do taste fresher than what you would normally expect for Chinese food. So, overall, not a terrible experience.', ""My friend lives a short walk away from this restaurant, so a group of us decided to come for a Friday night dinner. The wait wasn't that long, which was surprising since it was during peak families-with-kids hour. Anyways, we all started off with some drinks and the chili boiled peanuts. One friend and I ordered cocktails - one with lychee and a Singapore Sling - while the others got beers. This place strikes me as sort of a Doc Chey's family place, so a cocktail menu was surprising, but nice. The drinks were fine, but I'd rather spend two dollars more on a cocktail and get it at a cocktail-driven restaurant than here. I got to try the peanuts, egg rolls, wontons in chili oil, General Tso's chicken, pepper steak, and mapo tofu with pork. The boiled peanuts were a nice southern-asian fusion. The egg rolls were huge and not that crunchy. The entrees I tried were all so so. The chicken wasn't crispy, the pepper steak was bland, and the mapo tofu was unbearably salty. Similar to other reviewers' experiences though, the service was friendly. Double Dragon sources their ingredients locally I believe, which must be why prices are higher. For this type of comfort American Chinese food though, I'd rather eat my GMOs and MSG."", 'Tonight was our first dinner at Double Dragon, after waiting for them to find their feet since most of our friends had negative reviews on the opening month.First impression:We were told the wait would be 10 minutes, which was fine with us, and it was only about 5. \xa0We stood by the bar for a minute while our kids checked out the dairy bar and looking in to the restaurant my eye went right to the back corner where I could see in to the kitchen and a horrible pile of junk that looked like the server\'s station. \xa0As it turned out we were seated right next to it, and things looked even worse up close (see pictures)The server was nice and asked us if we had ever been there before? \xa0When we told her this was our first visit she told us about the quality of the ingredients and the ""Family style"" concept, which she described as ""Since it\'s family style we bring each dish out as it\'s ready rather than all at once"". \xa0Scratching my head I thought, I\'m pretty sure that ""Family Style"" means that diners share large plates and serve themselves. \xa0(disclaimer: I design retail and commercial environments for a living)The restaurant:It\'s shocking to me that they spent so much time working on this space and this is what they came up with. \xa0I walk past this place twice a day taking my kids to/from school and I know they pulled 3+ dumpsters out and put a lot of time in to it. \xa0However, the tile looks so dirty and the layout seems like a leftover from the previous tenant, so I\'m not sure what they did other than demo and focus on the bar and mural?The area next to the server\'s station was used to store the highchairs, boosters, extra chairs, trash can and brooms. \xa0It was pretty nasty and said to me as a parent that they don\'t really care about my kids (see pictures). \xa0A feeling that was echoed by the kids menu which was the same as the regular menu with the spicy items removed (at full price). \xa0I\'m surprised that the Oakhurst Stroller Mafia is tolerating this ;-) As for the Dairy Bar, it was so dark on the service counter that we couldn\'t see what the toppings were, and the opaque containers were not helping.All of this are easy fixes, but I think ultimately ODB & DD Suffer from the problem as My Parents\' Basement, they are so in love with the concept (which admittedly is great) that they are blind to all the flaws in it\'s execution.The food:For me, General Tso\'s Chicken is a benchmark for any Chinese restaurant, like a Margarita pizza for a Pizza Restaurant, so naturally I ordered that along with the Moo Shu pork and Sweet & Sour chicken. \xa0The food was delivered quickly and the Moo Shu pork was so salty that it was inedible, the waitress told us ""that\'s how it\'s supposed to be to balance the hoisin sauce"", then acknowledged that a bunch of other people had the same comment about it tonight. The best part of the General Tso\'s chicken, which was not good, where the hot peppers which had infinitely more flavor than the dish itself. \xa0The Sweet & Sour chicken was fine, and the chicken was well cooked. \xa0One of our dishes was cold, we only received 2 of the 3 rice sides that came with our entrees and none of our ""family style"" plates came with a serving utensil. Overall the food was pretty forgettable, and while I have no problem with the price point for quality ingredients, if the food isn\'t good then who cares? \xa0We will return for ice cream, but otherwise we\'ll skip the food and get delivery from one of the many ""Classic American Chinese food"" options in Decatur.Bottom line:When looking at the check we realized that for the same price we could have eaten at Scout and had a FAR superior meal and dining experience, or eaten at Matador and paid half and had the same dining experience.Restaurant=1 starFood & service=3 stars*After posting these photos and a few quick thoughts on my Facebook page all of my friends that had been there said that they had the exact same experiences.', ""I really, really wanted to like this Chinese restaurant so bad since this is the closest Chinese restaurant in proximity to my house - seriously a 2-minute drive. Sadly, this new Chinese restaurant did not live up to the hype and I was not impressed. Parking on a Friday night was as expected. The parking lot was full, so we parked alongside the main road and crossed the street. The staff were pretty awesome - friendly and helpful wait service. The wait time was about 15 minutes (not a problem since understandably this was a Friday night). So the food is why I give this place 2 stars. They ran out of veggie rolls so we ordered the Sweet Potato Rangoon instead. We also ordered the Wontons, Boiled Peanuts, Salt and Pepper Squid, Mapo Tofu and Pork, Vegetable Chow Mein and Shrimp and Lobster sauce. Sigh... okay, lets start with the Salt and Pepper squid. Not worth the $13 in my opinion. The portion was an appetizer size. Lots of green onions on the plate and the squid was super chewy. Mapo Tofu with Vegetables - it looked like the Tofu was roughly chopped (Tofu looked like it was torn in chunks by hand) and had a very salty sauce. It had sliced eggplants which I actually liked. Vegetable Chow Mein - not too bad actually. Saltier than I normally like, but overall was an okay dish. Shrimp and Lobster sauce - not sure what happened here. Some shrimp had heads and full on shells and some shrimp had no heads and shells completely off. The sauce looked exactly like egg drop soup and the seafood in the dish didn't taste right a little sour. Lots of green onions on top. The most amazing element here was the rice. It was not fully cooked! I have never, ever been to a Chinese restaurant where the rice was half cooked. Maybe, it was crispy, you ask? The rice texture was hard and I can assure you, it was not fully cooked. I did ask the waiter for fully cooked rice and the replacement bowl of rice was perfect so maybe they had one bad batch?The only saving grace here was the wait staff - nice, friendly people. Will I visit again? Probably not. I'll take the extra 20 minutes and drive over to Buford Highway instead."", ""So I ordered for the second time. \xa0Whereas the first time I was nearly shocked by how good the food was, the second order was revolting. \xa0The fried rice was mushy, greasy, flavorless (save a burnt taste), and there were nearly invisible beef scrapes rather than the excellent five-spicy beef in the last order. \xa0The General Tsao's chicken was gummy and lacked seasoning. \xa0 The egg rolls were dripping in oil. \xa0I am so bummed. \xa0I was starving after a long road trip and had a craving for Americanized Chinese food. \xa0It was so awful that I threw everything out except for the fried dumplings which were good but not as good as last time. I was listening to an interview with Thomas Keller today. \xa0He said that the truth is that what a chef does is repeat the same task the same way over and over rather than just producing delicious food. \xa0This order failed on both accounts."", ""DD is a relatively new restaurant in the Oakhurst area of Decatur. \xa0It is owned by the folks that run Taiyo Ramen. \xa0There is dedicated parking for this restaurant and the other 2 businesses adjacent to it in a small lot (free), as well as street parking. \xa0We arrived around 6'ish and there was plenty of seating available. \xa0Staff was prompt and seemed friendly. \xa0The menu has good options including vegetarian, poultry, seafood, & pork. \xa0The bar is full. \xa0On Tuesdays there are tiki drink specials, and on Wed 1/2 price on some wine bottles.

"[""Since moving back to greater Boston, I've walked past this location a handful of times, after first spotting it when I was living in NYC (but not trying it there). I decided to finally check it out here. The server behind the counter was super accommodating and friendly, and recommended the Milk Bar Pie--which I was initially already leaning towards. I was surprised that as another Yelper had mentioned, it came in a McDonald's looking apple pie box--and was admittedly taken aback at the size of the slice itself. The taste was pretty good (definitely loaded with sugar), and was a bit... chewy/tough. In some bites, more the latter.

It\'s low lighting, there\'s a giant wine rack wall and a couple different rooms decorated with modern- Asian compliments. I loved the atmosphere.The sushi was good. It really was. Everything we got was satisfying, but it was also pretty expensive. Sushi is not known to be cheap, but typically the pricier it is the more divine and unforgettable. But I\'ve had better sushi at half the price, respectfully. There just wasn\'t anything about the rolls we tried that had a ""wow"" factor. In fact, the best part of the meal was by far the Miso Soup. Our incredible and personable waiter Michael (shout out) told us they use truffle butter to make their miso- let me tell you, it\'s a level up!As charming as the restaurant was, I probably wouldn\'t return. Like I said, it was really spendy for good sushi (versus great or outstanding). If I\'m going to pay high prices for food, I\'ll try a different restaurant and see if the $$$ is at least worth being spent. I wish I could say more here. But definitely try the miso!', ""Service was great. The server even brought a sample of the Ramen broth after hearing we were interested in tasting but didn't want a whole bowl. Unfortunately it was way too salty. So salty it covered up ANY/ALL flavors of the tonkatsu it may have had.The pork belly bao is 5 star. Comes out hot and fresh, the pork belly I can tell they cook low and slow, so it is SO soft and melts like butter on the tongue. Ordered a second set at the end... you know... to check for consistency...The lime/garlic edamame was a little too sour for our taste but it was unique flavor combo we hadn't seem yet.Sweetheart roll was great, combined a sweet outside with savory inside that melded together nicely on the tongue.The gentlemen seemed unique but slightly nland in flavor, only to be saved by the Wasabi aioli. (Not spicy at all, just a hint. So good)Would return for bao and the Sweetheart w/ side of Wasabi aioli (and possibly try others)""]",positive

Still \xa0I would recommend this place if you are a sushi person.', 'I have been going to Minado since elementary school. As I write this, I\'m in my late 20\'s. When I started going, the quality and variety were superb. There were often lines to get in that could go for over an hour if you came at a popular time. Since then, the quality started declining little by little. It began when the rice made by hand started being made by machine... but this may be forgivable if it were it. I had visited for the last time in mid-December 2021, and I left very disappointed and almost devastated, but somehow not surprised. The hand rolls (temaki)? Gone. Salmon in a delicious green sauce? Gone. Oysters? Fuggedaboutit. Variety? Pitiful. A shell of the greatness Minado used to be. Other than crepes, no desserts survived. Then there was the quality of what was out there. The maki had become very small (depth-wise) and fell apart before hitting the plate. There used to be pieces that shined, but now there wasn\'t one I had where I thought: ""whatever that piece was, I want another!""If you find something you like, enjoy it while it\'s on your plate. You might have to wait an outrageously long time for more if you\'re lucky. The salmon roe sushi (rice topped with caviar and cucumber in a nori wrap) had two dilapidated pieces. This was it; more weren\'t made for our entire visit. There used to be six people working making the rolls; there were now two. Oh, and if you\'re cooking food that is literally right below you, put your mask over your nose... for crying out loud.I can\'t negate the effect of the pandemic. Still, I went once Minado had reopened. You were given everything by servers, and variety was relatively limited. At least quality back then hadn\'t dropped this low. Now they are back to self-service, and quality and variety went down the drain. I would rather they raised prices. Visit date = 12/13/2021', ""A great seafood buffet! I haven't been to a buffet in a long long time and was glad to check out this place. My boyfriend and I came a little after the restaurant opened for dinner and was immediately offered a seat. There's a hot food station, cold food station, and a sushi station that offered great selections of seafood, meat, and veggies. Everything was really good. The staff members were also super friendly and attentive. Definitely come on an empty stomach and be prepared to eat a lot!"", ""I just love MINADOS! I wish they had crab legs though. To replace the crab legs, they added in a lot of different seafoods. Crawfish, fried fish , clams, mussels , baked New Zealand mussels, soft shell crabs and jumbo shrimps . Can't really go wrong with that when you pair it with grilled Korean short ribs! It's $29 for dinner on weekdays. That includes everything I mentioned and more. For example, sushi and fried rice and etc. hands down probably one of the best Japanese / Chinese buffet around the area. I believe it's $31-$32 on The Weeknd's. The staff is super nice and friendly. Very helpful. Always on top of it when you're done with your plates. Due to covid they required masks. When going up to get your food, you're required to wear gloves to get your food. Super clean and strict due to covid. You'll feel safe going here. Just a rant : I really love Flaming Grill buffet. But I've gone to Minados a lot growing up. You can definitely tell the difference . I know flaming is cheap so you can get a bang for your buck and Minados can be expensive and hefty. But you'll see and feel the difference when you go to both. Flaming seems like they're strict with their regulations due to covid but they're not. You still have customers going around with no mask and no gloves . Letting their kids running wild . Minado's is a much more cleaner and well organized environment .

They give you gloves and you have to wear your mask before going up to get food, and the cooked food is in a line on the right and sushi is a different line on the left. The cooked food wasn't very good. The only thing I liked was the bowl of udon noodle soup, and the squid. The kalbi meat was a bit dry and sitting out there for too long. The noodles weren't very tasty either. I liked the sushi though! It was better than I expected, and they had a lot of variety. They refilled sushi pretty quickly too, every time I went up there was more sashimi and nigiris (my favorites). Service was good, we had a really nice server. I don't know if it's worth $30 a person though, the hot food was no good, and the sushi was mediocre."", ""Used to love the food years ago but the kitchen manager changed or so I heard and the quality went downhill.

I think these are from other places which they bring in to sell. I also bought the fried dough stick. To their credit they did tell me it was a day old and the fresh ones would arrive in half an hour. Unfortunately I could not wait. They did not offer any discount on that. They suggested reheat it in the oven covered with foil or air fryer. I reheated know air fryer and they crisped up nicely. Great in congee. The other items I bought were sadly not so tasty. Everything was cold. Not room temperature but chiller temperature cold. The egg tart and chicken pie were not very nice, especially when compared to the nearby Asian bakery across the street.

I've eaten here three times now and they don't quite deserve a four star overall review, but the eggplant parmigiana saved them. The first time I had the caprese panini and I couldn't finish it. It had two thick slices of mozzarella, one super thin slice of tomato, and one tiny basil leaf. The first few bites were purely bread and cheese, and not in a good way. It was very heavy and the tomato and basil ratio were way off to the mozzarella. The second time I played it safe and got the Caesar salad and minestrone soup. It was severely underwhelming. Minestrone is one of my favorite soups but this one was lacking in salt. The third time I got the eggplant parmigiana and I finally found something I loved. It came with a huge serving of spaghetti so you could even split it. However, the edges were pretty burnt, but still good overall.

It occurs to me that lamenting over Cajun and Creole cuisine in Austin is probably a lot like living in New Orleans and wondering why you can\'t get superb moist brisket and ribs on every street corner -- sometimes, you just gotta go with the flow.

Looks like they\'ve been around for a few years.Parking is available on the narrow side streets.The place is quiteFood is a wee bit pricier, but the quality is there and the portions are nice and big. I was ready to explode. Great value.I tried their chicken and lamb curries. This place gives the word ""hot"" justice. Most other places around town suck in this department (their ""hot"" dishes are more like medium/mild in my books), but the food here had a decent amount of heat. With that said, a bit more would be nice. Decent amount of meat, and goes well with naan and rice (not included).Special mention goes to their garlic naan. Nice and moist but not covered in grease. This thing was a bit smaller than a cafeteria tray. More than enough to wipe up all the curry sauce.The samosas are one of the bigger ones, but they were definitely on the pricier size. Comes with sauces (sweet brown, tangy green, spicy orange). Personally I\'d skip these, as the regular food items are more than enough for gorging oneself.I will definitely be back. Recommended.', 'I visited back in May, so this is a very delayed review! I went with a few friends with a reservation at 5:30. The friend I was driving with and I underestimated traffic and were almost 15 minutes late, but our other friend got there on time and they seated her and waited for us, which we were very grateful for! But, maybe because we were late, I felt like our waitress was pretty impatient with us for the rest of the night. The reservation was until 7 pm, we were finished eating around 6:30, but she didn\'t give us the bill until 6:52 and then tried to rush us out as if it was our fault we were still there.Food was really good! I got the Kashmiri Naan and the Mughlai Paneer Korma. The naan was otherworldly... the thick fruit and nut stuffing was so rich and delicious. I\'ve had similar naans with fruit and nuts mixed in but I\'ve never had anything like this where they\'re minced into a fine paste. This almost could have been a dessert. I also tried their garlic and plain naan, and while nothing could compare to the Kashmiri, I have to say I was also very impressed by their garlic naan.For the korma, I thought it was interesting that they garnished it with desiccated coconut and thought this added a nice flavour to go with the sweetness of the dish. The sauce was also very creamy and flavourful. I got medium spice and it was on the spicier side as far as mediums go, but it was good for me. One of my friends ordered his Lamb Rogan Josh ""very mild"" and it was reportedly pretty spicy. Even though he has zero spice tolerance, no one would be sweating like that from a ""mild"" dish, so either they messed up and gave him the wrong spice level or their ""mild"" for some dishes is simply not mild. Other friend ordered mild on a different dish but was fine. We were all stuffed. I just barely finished my dish and the others had leftovers. Price is fair for the good food and for the filling portions.We ate outside but I got a look at the interior when I went to the washroom and wow! As others have noticed, it\'s beautiful in there.Although the food was amazing, I don\'t really know if this would be my first choice to come back to simply because the service was unpleasant and kind of put a damper on things, and there are plenty of Indian restaurants that are almost as good and closer to me, but I\'m definitely not opposed to giving them another try since others seem to have had good experiences.', ""INDIAN CUISINE ALERT. This place not only has an amazing interior but also a outstanding menu with all sorts of variety giving you many choices to choose from.*Gobi aloo ($16) ~ this was delicious the aloo gobi was thick and well seasoned.

Wish there was more cauliflower as it was mainly potatoes.*Butter chicken ($16.75) ~ this was a classic we got mild and it was not spicy at all! It was creamy and smooth. The chicken was a bit dry and rough but overall I like the butter chicken.*Tandoori wings ($12.75) ~ very well seasoned. Jam packed with flavour and loads of sautéed veggies on top. The chicken wings were juicy and nicely cooked.*Achari Cod tandoori ($22.75) ~ the cod was so good. It was so soft and tender it was super flaky. The seasoning was super good and this was amazing with the chutney variety.*Paneer pakora ($14.50) ~ this was good. Loads of cheese in it. I recommend eating this hot because when it's cold it's no longer cheesy! This is good with the chutney sauces!*Chatpata Sev puri ($12.50) ~ AMAZING 100% must try! First time having this dish and 100% not the last. It was crunchy and crispy and full of flavours. Super refreshing and yummy!

Not too oily.*Spinach & paneer naan ($5.50) ~ my fav of the 3 naans we got! This was cheesy and loaded with spinach!

Nasi Goreng was a favourite! It had a nice chewy texture in the rice that reminded me of Chinese sticky rice! The Beef Rendang was very flavourful too. I would recommend skipping the roti because it just wasn't the same add the fluffy ones you get at the restaurants. The Casava cake was neat to try. It was a chewy Tapioca like cake that has a cane scar taste. Read great things about their laksa too and would have to hit them up again next time!

Sometimes she runs out very quickly. I usually get the shrimp laksa and comes with tofu puffs, egg, and fish balls sliced.

Which I was considering recommending to some clients of mine to visit. My husband and I wanted something different from the complimentary beverages that were being offered. (which were great).So we walked to the bar, just as we walked up a young lady was leaving. I sat in her seat and my husband sat down as well. I saw the ladies were pretty busy, so we waited patiently. One of the bartenders left and there was one bar back and one bartender. So we continue to wait patiently. So two gentlemen walk up from the same party we are with and get served immediately. Wow! So we continue to wait the other bartender returns and I say excuse me "" Can we get a drink She looked me up and down and said one moment. We said our good byes and left.  Food was great!', 'Rodney\'s Jamaican Soul Food has been in my Yelp bookmarks ""To Try"" for a while. This Jamaican and soul food ""fusion"" restaurant has been around for nearly a decade (opened 2011, I believe). It\'s located in Cumberland Square North, the shopping center with Goodwill and restaurants like Olive Garden, Pho Dakao, Tacos La Villa, The Pirate\'s Boil, and Yakitori Jinbei, on Cobb Parkway across from Best Buy. My friends and I agreed the dinner we had from this restaurant was delicious. Service was great too.Along with serving lunch and dinner, Rodney\'s also functions as a late-night hangout spot (club/lounge) on Friday and Saturday nights when the business is open until 2am next day. They bring in DJs and host various events. Check out their Facebook and Instagram pages for more info.FB: facebook.com/Rodneys-Jam…IG: instagram.com/rodneyscui…Inside, this restaurant has a spacious dining room with large, U-shaped booths, ideal for large groups and parties. They have a bar too, with plenty of TVs all around. In addition, they have a covered outdoor patio (storefront), but it was closed during my visit (the outside furniture was stacked up and put away). This is a casual place with a relaxed, comfortable, laid-back atmosphere.My friends and I referred to the dinner menu on Rodney\'s website (rodneyscuisine.com) and I called in our order for a Wednesday 6pm pickup. Our order was ready around 6:10pm and I paid in person. There were no issues with the order and the person I spoke with on the phone (the server name on my ticket says Darius, but I think someone else rung me up) repeated my order back to me for confirmation. I\'ve had mix-ups on takeout orders at different restaurants recently, so I\'m glad he did that.Here\'s what we got:* Brown Stew Chicken ($14.25) - pan-seared chicken slow-cooked in brown gravy with collard greens and steamed rice* Jerk Chicken ($15.25) - grilled chicken marinated in house jerk seasonings with steamed cabbage with vegetable medley and fried plantains* Jerk Pork ($15.50) - grilled pork marinated in house seasonings and topped with country gravy with cream corn and fried plantains* Oxtail Stew ($20.50) - braised oxtail slowly cooked with vegetables and butter beans with callaloo and fried plantains* DG Jamaican Ginger Beer ($2.25 per bottle)Around the table, everyone talked about how delicious their food was. My friend who ordered the Brown Stew Chicken, she\'s a picky eater and even she said she couldn\'t stop eating it. It was that good to her. I heard both the Jerk Chicken and Jerk Pork were nice and spicy. Meat portions were generous, especially for my oxtail. I\'ve had oxtail several times in/around Atlanta -- this oxtail from Rodney\'s was by far the meatiest and heartiest I\'ve tried. I was impressed with how thick and chunky the pieces of meat on the bone were and how tender and flavorful it was too. The stew was rich and savory. I should have ordered some rice for myself to mix in and not let any of the tasty stew go to waste. Based on our reactions, I don\'t think you can go wrong with any of the above entree selections.All dinner entrees come with a side. I was a little underwhelmed with the fried plantains. They were plain and not very flavorful. I had to dip mine in the oxtail stew to get some flavor on them. The callaloo was outstanding. I highly recommend it. If you\'ve never heard of callaloo before, it\'s a popular leafy green Caribbean vegetable dish. The version I had from Rodney\'s contained a little bit of carrot and some (I think) white onion too. I likened it to creamed spinach. Yummy and addictive. The ""steamed rice"" on the menu is white rice.The prices we paid are generally what you can expect at dinner, though they do have more expensive dishes like Rodney\'s Surf & Turf ($32.70) and Jerk Lamb Chops ($32.20). You can get many of the same entrees for less at lunchtime, Monday-Friday, 11am-3pm. For example, at lunch, the Brown Stew Chicken is $11.75, Jerk Chicken $12.25, Jerk Pork $12.50, and Oxtail Stew $16.00. And lunch entrees come with two sides too. I\'m not sure how much the portions differ. Aside from Jamaican and Caribbean fare, Rodney\'s also offers vegetarian dishes like Curried Tofu, salads, soups, sandwiches, burgers, and pasta. Soul food comes in the form of sides like black eyed peas, buttermilk mashed potatoes, and mac & cheese.I had a couple friends in Smyrna notice the pictures of the food I posted from this place on Instagram and Twitter. They\'d known about this place, but have never been. I\'ll write here what I said to them -- the food was very good. If you like Jamaican food, I think Rodney\'s is definitely worth checking out.', ""Sunday my daughter and her 2 girls took me to lunch at Rodney's and it was so nice!!! I love a nice table setting and the food presentation was very pleasing to me, the food even better. We had oxtails-- delicious, moist, and tender, the sumptuous brown gravy over a side of rice and peas was lip-smacking matched with sweet potato and steamed cabbage sides was the best. Thanks, Rodney. And, thank you to your polite wait staff!!"", ""I can't find good authentic Jamaican food in Atlanta to save my life! I was told this place was great! *Oxtails- dry and tough & overcooked with no flavor! I had to add seasoning at home. *Rice- standard*Mac & cheese....

"[""I've been to Asian Chao in a couple different airports now, and honestly it's exactly what you think it would be - a carbon copy Americanized Chinese joint. Did I know this? Yes. Did I care?

It's about $9 for some mediocre broccoli, carrots, and onions. The sauce is disgusting and salty. It doesn't even comes with rice, which you have to pay extra to get. There's not much else there. Small portions. Tastes old and like they haven't put in any seasoning. Bring food to the airport. It's better. Totally a waste."", ""I regret eating here and may self-induce vomiting if I start to feel sick.

She then said that the person serving the food didn't know what he was doing and that it was just too bad, not even offering a price adjustment.As I continued to argue, she looked at me with disbelief to other customers in line.

The dish (see my picture) was packed. Healthy portion of meats, lots of veggies and herbs, and a bunch of noodles. They also still gave me the egg roll sauce if you need some dipping sauce.

However, the real star of the show is the food and drinks. I'll start with everyone's favorite: drinks. They have a big list of things to choose from but the thing that caught my eye is that the first page of their cocktail menu is Taylor Swift themed drinks. Yes, you read that right! Just like her album, Red, they also hit their 10 year anniversary in 22. The drinks are strong and mostly dark liquor based which isn't my cup of tea but my boyfriend loved it.The food blew me away! We had the veggie burger with fries and the mac and cheese. I don't care what anyone says, this is the best veggie burger in town. It's made in house and you can tell love was put into crafting this masterpiece. The fries were also amazing. The mac and cheese took me away.

Sat down and almost immediately ordered drinks and appetizers. As we unmasked we noticed that the brash rule seemed arbitrary due to the lack of social distancing. Our table was spaced no more than 18 inches from the tables on both sides of us (which were occupied). The bar was completely full, spacing maybe less than a foot between stools. What is the point of the paper masks?!20 minutes go by and we finally received a glass of wine and a cocktail. Mind you, we ordered fries and a cold appetizer at the exact same time.

The waitress said it was one of her favorite drinks so why not, they must know what they\'re doing. Let me tell you, they do not. Whoever decided to layer scotch and Campari should go straight to jail. It was the most disgusting drink I\'ve ever had and the first ever that neither of us could finish.

We also got the hummus and when they say ""on toast"" that\'s exactly what they mean, you get one piece of toast with the hummus already on it that you have to cut up to share, instead of just being normal and serving the hummus with toast points. The only redeeming thing on the menu was the mushroom Mac and cheese, it was delicious and I wouldn\'t change a thing. The last thing that put a bad taste in my mouth is the automatic 20% charged on every order for ""employee wellness.""

Magic wok tries to bring exotic cuisine here, but didn't taste magic...Most of time we stayed, felt like one (wo)man show, through ordering, cooking and cleaning afterwards, maybe there was a chef in the back kitchen. But felt sometimes there was no one at the front."", 'Magic Wok was absolutely amazing. They have an authentic Shanghai traditional menu in addition the their regular menu. The lady gave me some great suggestions and explained the different traditional dishes. The Shanghai soup Dumplings were out of this world!!!! Steamed shrimp dumplings were amazing as well. Great little place to experience in the Orlando area. Close to Universal also which was a bonus for us.', 'The food is good here but the space is tight and old. I think the kitchen needs more venting cuz the greasy smells are so obvious and everywhere once you walked in. And when you finish your food and leave you are covered in cooking smell. Plus the wait time is very very long, just like all the other ""home owned"" restaurants I would assume there is only one chef who is able to do the actual cooking. We ordered six dishes but by the fifth one came we are already full.', ""I ordered a sweet and sour soup and I didn't finish it. It \xa0overly on the sour side and I've definitely eaten a lot of sweet and sour soup. I did, however, like they're wonton strips that come with the soup! So good. They are also very nice over there and the vibe is good when you walk in. I will try something other than the soup next time and update my review! Another note: the door was really hard to open so that might be something they want to either fix or put a sign up for."", 'Located in an assuming strip-mall you might think magic wok is just another Chinese take out joint, but they actually have an extensive menu specializing in cuisine from Shanghai. It seemed like a husband and wife owned place which they did all the cooking and serving so don\'t come here if you are in a time crunch. \xa0We were the only table in the restaurant at 8pm on a Sunday and our food still took a little extra time. We came specifically for some xiao long bao ""soup dumplings"" (that I called ahead to make sure they served) but unfortunately, they didn\'t have any soup inside of them-bummer. We also ordered the scallion pancake, sweet and sour boneless pork chop and Chinese broccoli with shiitake mushrooms. They were all tasty and not greasy at all.', ""Food's ok, but the waiting for the order is horrible. Wanted to walk out but the Wifey said no.

Waited for this soup more than one hour and no any apology.I just found they charge me $5.6 for tip, this is terrible!!

Such behavior is poor for the business environment and should never be encouraged."", ""If you want homemade quality Chinese food, don't miss this place!!We stopped in because we were in the area and didn't know what to expect (thought run of the mill... but was so pleasantly surprised . Turned out to be delicious. We watched the owner making dumplings and talked to her and her son and got the scoop on the restaurant's family history.The crab Rangoon was amazing, and we found out that everything they offer is made there from scratch. It tasted like it, and I got pics of the lady making some dumplings for the day.Also ordered some typical dishes - beef and broccoli with a brown fried rice and orange chicken --they were delicious and now that I know how fresh and great this lady and her family cook, I'll definitely go back for a more elaborate meal!!!

Always ask for the aji, chimichurro and the pink sauce!It almost always is super packed here so we like to go during the week before 6 but it is worth the wait!

I have been here multiple times throughout the years and the service has always just enhanced the entire dining experience. Today was no exception. I came here with several clients and one has a severe gluten allergy. Our server was attentive and went out of her way to make sure that his dietary needs were being met.These clients were from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and I thought this would be a unique enough experience for them to try. As I had expected, they had never had Colombian food before and they were raving about the total experience.The restaurant is clean and though it is not a fancy place, you do feel welcome and the Ambiance is pleasing and only makes for your lunch or dinner an even better time.I would definitely recommend this restaurant.

Also ordered the Bandeja Paisa as this is considered the most popular dish. It was heavy on protein and fat which was good for a keto diet. The meats were good except for the pork belly.

I would recommend if someone has an itch to try Columbian food and has not had before but not my favorite cuisine I've had."", 'The way to tell if the food is authentic Colombian, the beans.

"['Delicious little Indian restaurant in West Vancouver which serves original Indian dishes including very tasty curry dishes.I normally eat lunch here and my perennial favorite is the butter chicken curry served with rice and naan.

Since moving from its much larger space on Marine Drive (remember that wonderful deck they had?) a couple of years ago, Handi has settled into its new home on Bellevue. \xa0Although much smaller, the new space is still inviting with a warm decor and friendly staff. The service is generally pretty good, but the food is much better. Serving northern style cuisine, you'll find butter chicken, samosas, naan, chicken tikka masala, and lots of other favourites on their menu. In that old school Indian tradition, each dish is served in a heated pan. In a comfortable, open dining room with tables and booths, Handi lays your food out on a glass covered tablecloth. I'm not calling Handi elegant, but it could easily work for a date night. Best part, the food. The naan comes out warm and soft, and it all gets better from there. Handi's menu is complete, with lots of variations all the meat and vegetarian options, plenty of appetizers and best of all...Kingfisher Beer (unfortunately they don't have the big bottle). A quick word on Kingfisher beer, it's the beer you drank many times if you've ever visited India, I don't like beer, but Kingfisher I really like, a lot. It's not in every Indian restaurant, it's a find.Handi is a nice evening out, great food in a comfy atmosphere, but all that goodness doesn't come free, or even that cheap. Expect to pay around $30 per person, more if you find Kingfisher as delicious as I do. Worth every penny (sorry, no pennies, I meant 'nickel')."", ""We went in with no expectations at all, and came out surprisingly satisfied. First of all, all of the individual entrees came in their own individually heated dish so they stayed fairly hot/warm throughout the meal. Second, the entrees were tasty. The butter chicken was creamy, sweet, and yummy. The chicken tikka was tangy, spicy, and provided a flavor explosion with every bite. The naan was simple, primordial, and had that satisfying crispy yet chewy texture. Loved their weekday lunch. The weekend lunch buffet wasn't all bad, but the food seemed a bit lower in quality than when ordering a la carte. The standout in the buffet was the veggie curry dish. We were disappointed that the naan served with the buffet wasn't all you can eat. They capped it to one per paying customer.3.9 stars for their weekday lunch and 3.4 stars for the weekend buffet."", ""Handi in its old location was a dream restaurant with an awesome deck had many happy lunches and dinners.

"[""AMAZING! \xa0I have been wanting to check out this place for 2 years and we finally bit the bullet. The hold up has been the negative feedback from my trusted foodie friends. However, I have a feeling they all must have visited during a weird menu transition that they did not find pleasing because Odd Duck has great ratings! I could not acquire a reservation for 2 so we arrived around 4:45 to ensure we at least snagged a spot at the bar. However, the hostess provided us with a table on the patio with the knowledge that another party would be arriving at 7:00, no problem! I was thoroughly impressed that they had employees lined up behind the hostess stand to show each guest to their seat!  Happy Hour runs from 5-6 so we took advantage of their delicious $8 paloma's! I could seriously drink those all night! They also have 25% off bottles of wine under $100. We dined on the redfish ceviche which was refreshing, the cheddar cornbread that was so delicious, between 2 people, we ate the entire serving! The scallops were delicious, but I was obsessed with the celery escabeche that accompanied my husband's wagyu sirloin cap. I think the next time I will inquire about having the scallops prepared with the escabeche. We also tried the chocolate fudge pie, but although the dried chiles were only sprinkled on top of the pie, it was still too spicy for my husband.

The wagyu burger with collard green, chicharron and pimento was also a highlight, cooked perfectly and extremely juicy. \xa0Then came the 36 dollar wagyu sirloin cap... \xa0The aftertaste from this steak was horrid. \xa0I\'ve never encountered this flavor before but was a chemical taste that had me wretch, a few bites and had had enough. \xa0My wife also felt something was severely off, and we sent it back. \xa0The sear scallops (35 dollars) were just ok. \xa0A lovely sear, mediocre sauce miso butter sauce and 3 tiny scallops a complete let down.This restaurant thinks far too highly of itself. \xa0If you are going to act like a pricey exclusive restaurant that makes me jump through hoops to dine here and charges an arm and a leg, I better be wowed at ever step, and that\'s far from what happened.', 'I really wanted to like this place. We came here at the recommendation of multiple friends but I just felt like the food was good but not as exciting as the hype. I feel like the similar concept food in Chicago is much better.

Free valet parking', ""Having really high expectations for a restaurant can be a tricky thing. \xa0My expectations for Odd Duck were extraordinarily high... and the food, drink, and service blew my expectations away! \xa0This experience was simply an incredible delight for my tastebuds!I was seated at the bar and service was attentive and prompt! \xa0Prior to taking my order, the bartender asked if I had any food allergies or dietary restrictions. \xa0When I told him I was restricted to gluten-free items, he grabbed a special gluten-free menu for me and explained the differences to me. \xa0Most everything on the main menu was either gluten-free or could be made that way without differing from the original recipe too much!My visit was during Happy Hour. \xa0Odd Duck doesn't offer a ton of HH drink specials -- in fact, the paloma is the only cocktail at a reduced price. \xa0I opted for that and good thing I did because it was the perfect paloma! \xa0Truly the best I have ever had!Of course, I went there for the food... so let's talk about that. I started with the Redfish Ceviche -- I have enjoyed many variations of ceviche and Odd Duck delivered the absolute best! \xa0So far I was 2 for 2... so I was quite happy with myself, but also a little worried that the entree could not live up to the rest of the meal. \xa0My worries were silly and unfounded -- the Wagyu Sirloin Cap was packed with layers of flavor and was the best part of my meal!Overall rating:*****FIVE STARS*****Gluten-free rating:*****FIVE STARS*****"", ""The old fashion was made well. The food had incredible flavors. \xa0Tapas style. Loved the first two dishes: roasted carrots and mushroom tostada. The accompanying seasoning is incredible. The scallops were equally good, but only three scallops came in the dish. This was not so hearty given the price of the dish, but flavorful. The pork dish was nicely made, smoky flavor, had kind of an Indian grill feel to it... but for us the taste had a quick diminishing return. The dish was hearty though with a lot of meat on the plate. I wasn't too much in a dessert mood. Was simply going to have a spoon or two of the chocolate pie, but they brought out the donuts by mistake. Thank goodness, they were amazing. I enjoyed it more than the chocolate pie. Service tonight was simply outstanding. The waiter took my dietary restrictions to heart and really did a great job helping me navigate the menu. I wish more places did this. I felt the service here from our main and accompanying servers is what other restaurants should aspire to. Bathrooms were kept clean. I wish this place continued success. They have something really great going on!"", ""This was simply the best dining experience I've had in the recent years or maybe, ever. From beginning to end, I was thoroughly impressed with the staff and how easy and enjoyable it is to dine at Odd Duck. It's a place with friendly staff, great drinks AND great food, and ambience is casual but unique. Perfection.You can tell the owner takes their time to hire the right people because everyone we interacted with were so friendly. I think it matters a lot walking into a restaurant and enjoying a meal. Parking around this area is usually not the most pleasant but fear not, they have complementary valet parking! That easily eases off the anxiety of missing your reservation time because you were looping around the area for a decent parking spot. We came here on a Saturday at 5:30pm and it was perfect because I get hungry around that time. Okay, there are more reasons-it was not very crowded, it was happy hour for some drinks, and the lighting was perfect with the blinds pulled up since the sun has set. Surprisingly, the drinks here were super good, like high quality to sip on. I got the draft paloma and it was very well-balanced. The other drink we ordered was Nice, Bryce, we were eyeing it and the waiter also made that suggestion. Both are different and definitely would get again.Everyone was great about making their recommendations and the top choice was the scallops and ceviche. We couldn't get seafood this time around but I will definitely come back for those two items. Waiter was great at making recommendations based on what we like and what he thinks is great. Easy to talk to, checking in on us just enough, and other staffs help with serving the food and filling up the water so that was cool to see everyone work as a team.On to the food! So we got the cheddar cornbread, mushroom chorizo tostada, achiote roasted carrots, and wagyu sirloin cap. Cheddar cornbread is a must, it was fresh, the butter on it was amazing, and filling too. Mushroom chorizo tostada had a bit of citrusy to the flavor and it's delicious. For the achiote roasted carrots, what stood out to me was the burnt toast hummus!! I want a tub of that whatever it is! I think I would've liked more of the hummus and less chunks of the carrots. Don't get me wrong, the flavor profile is still very good, I think for my likings, the carrots can be slices so it's easier to consume. Wagyu sirloin cap was the star of the show for us, it was cooked very well (as in good job not well steak!), though I probably want it to be a bit more well.We came here to celebrate our anniversary but it is a casual place so this is good for a date night or regular dining! The great thing about this place is that the menu changes so you can always find reasons to come back here. I can't wait until I come back."", ""This place was delicious! The restaurant offers complimentary valet which is nice. The restaurant is decorated with wood from the original Shiner Brewery. The staff was very friendly and gave off the fantastic Austin vibes! We sat at the bar and had the frozen chili margarita. It had great flavor and was well balanced. I tasted the Paloma and it was one of the best I've ever had! I also had the Naked Lunch cocktail which has beets. I'm not a huge beet fan but I'd drink this again. There was a special cocktail called Buckle Up Buttercup. The drink was a little salty, a little sweet, and you could really taste the bourbon. For food we tried the kale beignets which were soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. We also had the mushroom chorizo tostada with beautiful, fresh bean sprouts on top. I LOVED the mushroom chorizo! I could put that s*** on everything. Lastly we had the ceviche. The fish was fresh and the homemade chips it came with were the perfect pair. As a first time guest, I was very impressed! I'll be coming back next time I visit Austin. Make sure to call a few weeks ahead for a reservation. They book up pretty fast! 10 out of 10 would recommend. The food was too good to take pictures"", ""Visited Odd Duck after months of waiting for a reservation, and was met with food and service that went above and beyond expectations. A local farm to table establishment with an elevated twist, I highly recommend Odd Duck as a go-to spot in Austin. As many other Yelpers have surely noted, Odd Duck's menu is seasonal, so I'll spare you the details regarding the food I ate, as the menu has most likely changed. Feel free to sit back and trust your waiter's suggestions, as they are veterans of their craft. One thing that I would like to commend Odd Duck on is their extreme attention to detail, which was immediately noticeable to me. From their unique plates and cutlery to the maintenance of their restrooms, this dining experience made it well worth the price point. Additionally, our waiter made it a point to clean our table throughout the meal, which was awesome.5/5"", ""Odd Duck is an OG in ATX's food scene; I've known about it since undergrad (10+ years now!) but haven't had a chance to try it until I was in town recently for work. Before local/farm2table was cool - Odd Duck was doing it. It still feels great to support local farmers & producers though. The food here was OUTSTANDINGLY flavorful -- bringing it to that edge but showing finesse and balance. I also appreciate that they made vegetarian versions of certain dishes so there are some options for Vegs! My only regret? Not coming here sooner! The menu will be different when you visit, but we thoroughly enjoyed each dish! We had the: *Redfish Ceviche (leche de tigre, persimmon, cucumber, potato chip)*Cajun Pork Rillette (apples, pickles, Sour Duck Market sourdough toast)*Dry-aged wagyu burger (pimento, BBQ sauce, beer battered onion ring) - like an EXPLOSION of flavor. *Wagyu Sirloin Cap (beef fat papas bravas, soubise, green bean salsa verde) *French Toast (Vanilla Ice Cream, Cajeta, Apple, Pecan, Brown Butter Cereal) - yes, we had French Toast for dessert! So good & I recall just a pinch of salt from keeping it from being overly sweet!"", ""Pictures of menu on August 17, 2021. Reservations are strongly recommended as this place is quite popular (rightfully so though)! We picked the tomatoes, quail, and cornbread and everything was 10/10. I don't typically eat cornbread but theirs is MAGICAL and a must do! Their service was also A+, they were kind enough to mark the menu with vegetarian options, they even provided ways to alter some of their dishes to make them vegetarian (see photo). The French Toast dessert was also a delight. I'm a big fan of their rotating menus and will happily return to try more. There is complimentary valet parking. You can also find street parking by the restaurant. They have happy hour 5-6pm daily with drink specials only.""]",positive
"[""Living a minute from this location, I am a Rally's regular. It's my go-to quick stop for a bite to eat.

Didn't stay to eat in, but the decor is sweet and they also have a bar. It's getting colder, but there's also outdoor seating. Can't wait to stop by again!"", ""From the outside Taco Party is unassuming, but from the inside is full of character.Every time we visit the city of Boston it's a no brainer since the whole family ( even the non vegan) love it.

FYI there's only street parking, so don't forget to bring quarters."", ""I brought my vegan friends from Connecticut to this restaurant because I \xa0come frequently and kinda like the food. However, we needed quarters for the parking on the street. We asked the staff (a man in the counter) if he could change a dollar for us to pay for quarters. We assured him we would order a large meal (we were a party of 7) and also tip him well if he could help us. \xa0The staff refused to help us (even though he did have quarters available) and forced us to leave. \xa0he said the quarters were for clients at night (???)The staff are rude and don't care about returning loyal customers who are making an effort to bring their out of state friends to the restaurant. We went down the street to the other vegan restaurant that exists: Vegan Bistro. The food at the other restaurant was amazing! Staff was super friendly and helpful.Don't waste your time with people who don't care about your business."", ""Came here on a Saturday evening. Ordered online for pickup but they have a few tables set up right outside (well spaced apart, available first-come first-serve) so ended up doing outdoor dining.We basically never go to vegan restaurants so weren't sure how it'd be but we had a surprisingly pleasant experience at Taco Party. Tried a couple of the tacos (Jackfruit Tinga, Lentils Al Pastor), a seitan chorizo torta, and nachos. The food was very well-prepared and of good quality. The texture of the jackfruit was good, as was the seitan. Everything tasted pretty good too, just a bit on the bland side. Wish the jackfruit was seasoned more; the seitan patty was a little too salty but otherwise not spiced. The sunflower seed cheese on the nachos was okay, but not great. It would've helped if the nachos had some more toppings like tomato, avocado, cilantro, and fresh jalapeños instead of pickled ones; caramelized onions would be a nice addition too. My favorite part of the meal was the lentil taco - the al pastor sauce in it had a nice kick to it and the bits of grilled pineapple worked perfectly.We also tried the oat milk horchata cocktail and really enjoyed it. Very boozy!Overall, we were happy to try some interesting vegan options. Some more flavorful sauces and use of spices and fresh veggies would really elevate the food."", 'Amazing tacos best tacos on the east coast by far my only recommendation would be for more baked/non fried options overall and whilst using whole grains which we prefer in the taco shell', ""Did a pit stop here for lunch, the food was amazing !Loved the tofu taco , \xa0the torta's , and the chimichurri tempeh!

"['TLDR: solid food in a beautiful interior. The inside certainly lives up to the name. Beautifully done with wood accents throughout and vintage looking lamps throughout Southern Proper has a gorgeous barn chic look to it. Food wise it has some classics like BBQ ribs and also fried chicken. There is an ample cocktail menu with your classics. Sides are full of Southern favorites like butter milk biscuits and collared greens. Sadly I only ate at this place on the night of its closing and it will sadly be no more.', ""Would've been a 4, but undercooked chicken (that was too visibly pink to be just blood) knocked it down to a 3 for me. Came here on Friday at 7:30 and it was really dead...We got the silver queen hushpuppies, pimento cheese, smoked pork shoulder, wedge fries, and 4pc hot.The hushpuppies and wedge fries were my least favorite dishes. The hushpuppies were dry and bland and the wedge fries were basic too potatoey. On the flip side the pimento cheese and pork shoulder alone was really good, enough so that it would make me wanna go back if not for the chicken...There's potential in the hot chicken, the spices were there but it's extremely unpleasant when you eat undercooked chicken. Kinda actually ruined my meal but ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯."", ""3.5 stars is about right. Ambiance is lovely and very curated. It's spacious, with unique prints/decor on the walls and ceiling, and has a bar with plenty of standing tables nearby. Drinks - Great mix of options! I chose a unique craft beer - a Guava Gose which I really enjoyed.Food - Hit or miss. The two hits of the night were the fried chicken and the pork ribs. Fried chicken was very crispy and seasoned on the outside and juicy on the inside. Definitely an adventure for your tastebuds. I was rather impressed with the pork ribs (something I'm rarely impressed by in Boston), they were smokey and smothered in flavorful sauce that permeated the whole rib.The pimento mac & cheese and fried okra left more to be wanted. Mac & cheese had a hint of sweetness, but overall cheese fell flat and had a sort of fake flavor to it. Fried okra looked promising, but it was chewy and hard to eat.Price - on the higher side."", ""We stopped by for dinner on a Friday night. Restaurant was mostly empty around 6pm so we were promptly seated. The interior of this restaurant is very rustic, high ceilings and wooden features. There are quite a number of tables which is good for large groups. We ordered a variety of items including:Biscuits4pc hot fried chicken1/2 lb pulled porkCrispy BrusselsEverything was surprisingly delicious! The biscuits were most and flaky. They're served with butter and a bomb blueberry sauce. The fried chicken was crispy and came in a dry rub style. The hot is spicy but not unbearable. The batter was slightly thicker than I preferred but it was still crunchy. The pulled pork was the star of the night. It was very moist and flavorful. We loved that it was served with sweet rolls and slaw. It's like BYO sliders! The crispy brussels were flavorful but too oily for my liking. Overall it was a good experience! Food was reasonable priced and portions were satisfactory."", ""I'd say more like 3.5, in that we would definitely return. We went last night and were thrilled to find parking right next to the restaurant. We had made a 6:45 reservation, and while the outdoor seating area was busy, the inside wasn't really--also a big summer vacation week this week. Our server was very nice and took of us well the whole way through. We ordered hush puppies, farmers salad, cornbread, and the 8-piece chicken (half spicy, half classic). We started with the hush puppies, which were admittedly quite dry. The accompanying butter tasted delicious--homemade, even, but with the salt of the hush puppies and the salted butter, it was too much for me. The farmer's salad was very good, but just so salty. I would have absolutely loved that dressing if it wasn't for the salt overload. The fried chicken and cornbread were the best parts. I read reviews saying the fried chicken was dry/not seasoned but I did NOT find that to be the case. It was perfectly cooked on the outside, crispy, and juicy on the inside. I really enjoyed it. Cornbread had a crumbly-ness to it, but the butter and flavor was divine alongside the chicken. I would definitely definitely go back for the chicken and cornbread. Especially since they are both 100% gluten free! This place deserves credit for marking their menu well for allergies and actually following through. My husband's beer was delicious, he reports, and served in a rather beautiful but small glass. I do feel that this place has even more potential than its presently realizing--with just a few tweaks to menu items, it could be outstanding instead of just good."", ""A great spot for brunch! There is plenty of outdoor seating and given that Harrison isn't a very busy street, it makes for a peaceful outdoor meal which can be rare in the city.While the portions aren't huge, the flavor definitely makes up for it. Everywhere I go, I order some sort of hash, and their version did not disappoint!I have yet to try their dinner, but given their menu isn't terribly expansive, you really have to be in the mood for fried chicken."", ""Some decent Southern food in Boston - at last! The Boy and I were reeling from a recent trip to South Carolina so we cashed in some OpenTable credits for a certificate to Southern Proper.To start we got Deviled Eggs - eat these little babies like they're served on top of that pickle to get that extra dill flavor in there. We also got the Pimento Cheese Popovers too. I personally found this popover a little heavy and a little dry but The Boy really enjoyed it - he loves pimento cheese - and I'll admit with the pepper jam, it was a great combination of flavors.We also ordered a Smoked Hot Link sausage; this was housemade and truly delicious, served with pickles, slaw, and a bevy of sauces. If the eggs didn't convince me, this tray did. PICKLES OUT OF THIS WORLD at Southern Proper. Also the mustard and barbecue are crazy addictive. You'll be dipping for days (or until you've gobbled that sausage!).Thank heavens we opted for the 4 piece Fried Chicken over the 8 because normally our eyes are bigger than our stomachs. You can totally do a half-n-half at SP by the way which is exactly what we did. Half classic (it's lemon & thyme) and half hot. BOTH of these were unreal and everyone knows I am the champion of spicy foods but the classic actually was my favorite between the two.For sides, we opted for Collard Greens and Grits & Butter. The greens are actually some of the best I've had in Boston but pass on the grits. I got excited because it had corn in it but it was lukewarm and the pats of butter were cold which might've been the suspect for not being served piping hot. Maybe we'll get the biscuits or corn bread next time.Without the certificate from OpenTable, this meal is pretty pricey (we did drinks too), but I also think it's worth the price for good Southern in Boston. Oh and they've got some pretty interesting/crazy combo cocktails. Not for my palette but maybe for yours."", 'I came with a friend for dinner. Ambiance was great. I love the mismatched dinnerware, the decor. The waitress was fabulous. She had the ""at home"" comfort I would want when I think of a southern restaurant. My friend got the fried chicken and steak fries. She loved the chicken. Great crunch, great portion size. I had the popovers and mac and cheese. The pimento popovers were amazing. I had never had pimento cheese before. It was a little spicy, a little sweet. I was surprised it was cold, but it paired well with the fresh from the oven popovers. I never even thought to offer to share them to be honest. The skillet cookie was different than I expected. Three decent sized cookie dough balls with ice cream perfectly melted in the center rather than one flat cookie base. We were both digging for the crusty, chewy cookie at the bottom!I only gave Southern Proper 4 stars because of the mac and cheese. It reminded me of boxed velveeta. The pasta itself was a bit more al dente than I would want. The cheese had great flavor but wasnt as creamy as I wanted.

To my dismay, the food was cold and a bit of a let down.Also, my friend's food came out 15 minutes before mine which left me staring into oblivion.

But not complaining...Old fashioned made with Four Roses (they dont have Makers) was supposedly really good. We got a bunch of small dishes to share, and they were all amazing! Biscuits with butter and jam, hush puppies, pimiento mac and cheese (it was light on the pimiento but heavyyyy on the cheese sauce, yum!!!), potato wedges (too big and thick for my personal liking), fried chicken sandwich-hot (BEST fried chicken sandwich EVER!!! Sooo flavorful--the buttered bread was amazing, the chicken was juicy and flavorful!). Also they kindly gave us a complimentary corn bread for dessert because they had an extra (true southern hospitality!) It was mildly sweet with some yummy butter on top.

The omakase is not a traditional one - it is very heavily influenced by Southeast Asian flavors (particularly, Vietnamese and Thai). This might be a matter of personal preference, but while I love Southeast Asian food generally, I didn\'t enjoy the extent to which it influenced the omakase.

It\'s a mystery. We sat at the bar, and each sushi was served one piece at a time that the two of us shared, and I believe we had around a dozen pieces for the entire omakase meal plus one bottle of sake that was 5 times that retail price ($20 is retail price, I know because I buy that bottle sometimes) that totaled $500. We are both from Japan, from the coast, and we have had a ton of fresh, extraordinary sushi in our lives. \xa0The sushi at Oya was SMALL in size compared to some of the high end sushi restaurants I\'ve eaten at. \xa0Real high end restaurants in Japan actually serve you thicker pieces of fish, or ""neta"".So much overkill of ingredients in each sushi. Caviar that could have worked well on sushi but killed the taste of the fish underneath. Total fail. For the price, I did not expect to see chopstick holders that looked like they were designed by elementary school kids sold at a 100 yen shop. The sushi chef looked depressed and unhappy to be there. He wasn\'t talkative but he looked familiar to me so I asked him where I knew him from. Turns out he used to work at the old Ginza sushi restaurant in Brookline I used to work at years back. No offense but for these prices you\'d expect they hire chefs from more high end sushi restaurants. After spending the entire $500 and having to pay 20% tip on top of that we left frustrated, dissatisfied, and hungry. I don\'t know why this restaurant is still in business, maybe people just haven\'t had good quality sushi and assume the food is good here because it\'s expensive and served one tiny piece at a time? Do yourself a favor. Don\'t waste your money coming here, and don\'t support a restaurant that rips off customers with outrageous price for poor quality foods.', ""Definitely Americanized omakase. I think it's worth trying once but I was disappointed based on all the hype. The waiters are nice, albeit the only actual Asian/Japanese employee I saw was the main chef. The weirdest parts to me were that they did not give ginger, they included a fork and knife, and no one was eating the nigiri pieces with their fingers as traditionally done (as well as no finger wipe for doing so). As for the actual food, I thought that I wouldn't be full from the whole menu until the Wagyu came out. The first 15 courses came out quickly, one after another, but the last 5 had 15-20 min between each one, which made my friend and I very hungry. The standouts were the Hokkaido Sea Urchin, Wild Spot Prawn, Homemade Fingerling Potato Chip, A5 Wagyu, and Mochi Donut dessert. The worst by far was the second Foie Gras course with chocolate balsamic (definitely for non-Asian tastebuds), very strange/unbalanced in my opinion to follow up the fatty Wagyu with foie gras. In general, I felt a lot of the fish courses had too much sauce/accessorization and it would have been better if it was just the fish itself. I've had omakase in NYC for significantly cheaper that impressed and satisfied me far more. But I guess this is the best of what you can get from the Boston food scene."", 'Best meal I have had in Boston! No surprise there! We got the sake/wine pairing as well.

Bathrooms were broken so we had to walk in the snow to a restaurant down the block- I know that was out of O ya's control, but it really felt like the sour cherry on top. We had to laugh. Most importantly- the food was subpar. We felt swindled. \xa0As others have mentioned, many of the dishes were overpowered by one ingredient- either a truffle or soy sauce or shallot.I expect high-end tasting portions to have a real balance of flavors.

"['I had the lucky chance to have dinner here on Valentine\'s Day. The restaurant was only open for a select number of guests and me since I\'d won the Yelp Orlando X Reyes Mezcaleria giveaway on IG. WOOHOO!They featured a 6-course menu + signature cocktails curated by Chef Wendy.The restaurant was beautiful and spacious. The high ceilings made the space feel expansive. It had a traditional, old-school vibe with vintage decor. We were escorted to our tables in twos and were seated side by side facing the bar/kitchen area, which was different. I\'ve never been seated like this before and I really liked it. This allowed for us to be able to chat and enjoy the view of our drinks being made and a peek into the kitchen.Shortly after being seated, they brought out the Pan de Casa which was warm, soft, fluffy, and exactly the way bread should be made. It came with whipped sweet honey butter. When I tried this combination I was taken aback and had to use my FULL food focus to NOT eat all the bread before the rest of the dishes came out.Florida Oyster Asado. Now, this dish was my favorite and absolutely to die for! ::deep sigh:: I really could have eaten 12 of these on my own they were so DAMN GOOD! I tried my luck and shot my shot, by saying, ""if there\'s more back there, bring them on over"" with a huge smile on my face. To my surprise WAABAM, here come more oysters for each of us. Now that\'s what you call VIP treatment. Ask and you shall receive. I\'d go back to Reyes just for the oysters. They were cooked to perfection with a sauce that left your mouth begging for more. *chefs kiss*Herb-roasted Prime Rib. When this dish arrived the first thing my cousin said was ""your food looks so much fun to eat."" Indeed it was a blast of fun and packed with flavor. The prime rib was served with 1/2 a pie on the side. That was an interesting blend of flavors but they worked really well together. The prime rib came with herbed butter melting on top adding an extra level of juiciness to it. The pie was crunchy and crispy and everything I needed it to be.Fun Food Fact: I\'m obsessed with crusts, they just really do it for me. LOLDessert: I really didn\'t think I was going to have space for the dessert but once it arrived on the table it was so beautiful, I couldn\'t NOT try it.

We were told that they are are planning to expand walk-in seating and that's good news. We asked the waiter for a red wine under $100 and he recommended the Domaine Bourgogne Pinot Noir ($95) which we enjoyed, it was on the lighter side and paired well with the heavy French food we were about to eat.

Generally everything was good but nothing to knock our socks off--disappointing considering the price. Spanish octopus, little coin-like slices of octopus served cold and tasting like cold chicken. Cape Cod Scallops with carrot and broccolini and a sweet aioli, the best dish of the night. (Though we complained because they served my wife the panchetta with it even though she had asked for a vegetarian version.)Ricotta Gnudi, tasted like regular gnocchi only smaller and rounder and just okay. Pork Loin on cannellini beans, pearled onions, green beans. Very good. (Complained because my wife's pescetarian version of the Pork Loin was just the vegetables with no addition, such as a fish or a pasta). Banana dessert, excellent, with chocolate filled pastry and warm banana. Due to our complaints about my wife's meal they very graciously comped her, bringing the final bill to a still hefty $280 with tip.

The noise was so distracting that it ruined any mood. The service this evening (for our table anyway) was less than stellar. Our server, Melissa, was polite, friendly, and accommodating.

I\'d heard good things about this place before but never made my way over. I\'m glad I did. Long story short, it was a cute little place with some great coffee!First off, I have to give praise to the server who made my coffee. I guess she overfilled my cup a bit and passed the spillage on to me. If this is how Reganomics really worked, I would\'ve been a Republican years ago. That bonus coffee was especially appreciated because--like I hinted at above--this coffee was pretty great. I got a cold brew with oat milk and it was the best I\'ve had out in a while. Oat milk is delicious, but it\'s so sweet that it\'s easy to overwhelm a coffee. They know what they\'re doing though and went a bit easy on it so my coffee still tasted like coffee (without any direction from me, I should mention). The menu calls it ""Jittery Joe\'s,"" and as a caffeine enthusiast, that makes me happy about my energy levels as I head back to work. (Note to wrong people that don\'t like caffeine: It didn\'t actually make me jittery.) I\'m tempted to pick up a bag of grounds on my way out to make at home. \xa0I also got a cup of breakfast potatoes mostly to have excuse to sit in the lounge longer. They were pretty tasty too. A bit crunchy with just enough seasoning. I really appreciated that they got that crispiness without adding bacon like every other stupid place does (I don\'t eat bacon). The decor was fun too. Kinda hipster vibes, which is completely reasonable for a cafe. Lots of impressionistic bike paintings. Could use some bean or wine paintings based on the name, but what do I know?Overall, great place.

After spending an hour at Leu Gardens down the street, I was hungry. Having only dined at East End Market in the area I was ready for a change in culinary scenery. Parking is a little tight if the lot is full but not to worry as it seems people come and go relatively quick in the area. I really dug the vibes B3 gave as soon as I walked in the door, the patrons are socially distanced and the cashier was pleasant. They had some interesting artwork along the wall as well as their menu which notated daily specials. After reviewing a somewhat extensive menu, I decided to go with The Tandem, which is a half sandwich, half salad option. For $10 bucks I thought it was a deal considering the location. For the sandwich I chose the Bettini Panini which consisted of mozzarella cheese, salami, pepperoni, ham, and pesto on locally sourced ciabatta bread then hot pressed. This sandwich was solid and the trio of meats gave it a nice Italian sandwich vibe. As for the salad, I chose the Greek which consisted of Romaine, greek olives, vine ripe tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers, banana peppers and feta cheese. Greek dressing served on the side. \xa0For a Greek salad it was pretty delicious, the only criticism I would have is the dressing is more solidified than I would have expected. It made it a little difficult to spread through the salad but I made it work. Now the diamond in the rough was the Amaretto White Chocolate Latte, I ordered it iced with oat milk. There was something about that combination of flavors that makes the latte to die for! Thanks B3, I will be back!', 'This is a great spot to go to get a quick meal or coffee.

Why go for something different when I can have perfection? And truly, every flavor and type of quiche I've tried here (they're constant rotating them to keep it fresh and interesting) have all been absolutely delicious and amazing. They've never been anything less than perfect. The egg is perfectly fluffy and moist, and the fillings are scattered throughout so you get a mouthful in every bite. The homemade honey whole wheat crust is what makes this quiche even better and steps it up a notch over every other competitor. It is so buttery and flaky, and doesn't just taste like normal pie crust. It's healthier and extremely flavorful that I don't even know I'm eating whole wheat. There's even a hint of sweetness from the honey. I usually go with the spinach, goat cheese, and sundried tomato quiche, but this time I tried the mushroom and Swiss. I think I might even like this one even better. Delicious! I always go with the Brussels sprouts slaw as my side option. It's so fresh, with that perfect hint of acidity from the citrus juice they use as the dressing. This cafe always delivers great service, fast and delicious food, and friendly top notch customer service.

Decided to take all of the breading off of it and compare it to hubby's chicken. It was the same. Why do waitstaff and restaurants always think customers are trying to get over? First things first, listen to the customer and actually see if the complaint is valid. Ever heard of the benefit of doubt. It took a 3rd person who works at the restaurant to come over to check it out. She asked what I ordered and said, yeah that's chicken. Problem is too much time had gone by trying to hunt the waitstaff down to get them to take the food back. In this day and age when businesses are suffering and customers are asked to support local businesses, it is equally important for businesses to find ways to listen to and appreciate customers. We choose to spend our money in your establishment. We ordered chicken to go to show the waitstaff we were not trying to get over by not paying! The fact that we have to do this is appalling! Final note: Mistakes happen. If the waitstaff had just listened and considered the food was wrong, the restaurant would have received a better review and possibly future customers.

"['The first thing that stands out after a great meal at Vij\'s is watching the bread being made in the clay oven. I\'m reminded of the late Ricky Jay doing slight of hand. I tried to get a picture of the dough being patted onto the inside of the concave oven - and I have one of them I phones with several million pixies in it - but all I got were blurs. If you were to stand near this baker woman in a crowd I\'m sure she could, if she wanted to, take your watch your phone and your underwear before you noticed they were gone.This was certainly the best naan bread I\'ve ever had. Most restaurants the dough is paper thin in places. This naan was consistently thick, though a bit on the chewy side.I put the bread up first as it is clearly the star of the show. The hostess told us the bread-maker had been at Vij\'s for twenty years.After we sat down we were given a cup of hot chai tea and two appetizers - the French call them ""abuse mouches"" or something to that effect. One was a re-deconstruction of a light chaat, the crunch provided by a cracker. Usually chaat comes with crunchy bits in a salad. The other was a samosa that came without the usual sauces - that was because it didn\'t need sauce.The waiter told us that the dishes are intended to be shared ""family style,"" which is the way it\'s supposed to be.It was clear that this is an Indian restaurant. I have come to dislike fusion restaurants: the labradoodles of the restaurant world. Nothing can be what it is any more: it has to be interbred with something else. Coffee is a great flavour but now we have hazelnut or vanilla soy lattes; sour cream and onion potato chips.;Chinese food with a western influence. Why? Mixing things sounds great, but if the thing itself is great why change it?So kudos to Vij for giving us recognizable Indian food and doing it really, really well. So this chai was chai flavoured chai. Make no mistake, this was not the powdered chai stuff they stick you with at Starstruck or your local coffee slop. This was the real deal made with milk, tea, spices and sugar - I usually find genuine chai too sweet but this was perfect. We had a late lunch but had booked an early dinner, so my appetite was on the low end. We shared two dishes and dessert. I will update this review as we try more and more dishes. My lamb pieces were tender and the sauce had that unmistakeable tang of tamarind and hot pepper. My wife said she had a piece that was tougher. The other dish was a cauliflower chick pea cake that was also delicious, although the two sauces were similar, but less spicy. These were served with the famous naan and great basmati rice.We took most of it home to have room for dessert and had a meal the next day. It was just as good, even the rice.The desserts were gulab jamum - golden globe awards in a sweet sauce with just the right amount of spice - and a rice pudding that was NOT a watery soup. It had a sprinkling of crunch topping, but to me, not quite enough flavour. The waiter was nice and attentive even though we were not big spenders that night. I find some restaurants the quality of service goes down proportionally the less alcohol you drink and the fewer dishes you cram down your gullet. I try to tip as if we had at least two drinks if the service stays good for a smaller meal.Our only complaint is that they didn\'t seat us in the upper dining room where the ambiance was clearly better. Maybe when we become regulars,We are sure to go back and will update. I love the way good Indian restaurants cook fish but all they had that night was lingcod and I\'ve gone off the lings after a bad experience. Look forward to a review of a fish dish.Will update you as we try new things.', 'Vij was a huge letdown Indian restaurant. Honestly not sure why its so popular. Positives: food is cheapNegatives:1. Food quality is very poor2. Does not taste like Indian flavors3. Everything seems rushed and low quality like a bad roadside dhaba', 'Mmm, mmm, mmmmm... it was all I could say in between bites.

Every bite was delicious, especially the Pork Spoon and the Bengali curry. The service was incredible with Vij himself greeting and checking on every guest. Just a beautiful meal all around.', ""Vij is the spot that we stumbled in on a rainy night. We ordered the pork lollipops, their samosas and also their curry's. We got the chicken curry and also ordered their lamb chops with curry as well. The food here was very delicious and I did enjoy it however I felt like the curries weren't really that stellar/I've had better elsewhere. They were really nice though and I like how they gave some small bites whenever you walked in. I thought that the lamb chops are kind of expensive honestly and I wish that you could probably just order the dish with like a rack of lamb versus having to order each individually. The service was great as well, I would order things other than the curries!"", ""What a beautiful patio at Vij's! \xa0 Even on a misty evening, it was warm enough to remove my coat as the patio is heated. \xa0I do not like eating with my coat on. \xa0The protocols in place are implemented and I felt 100% comfortable dining out. \xa0I grew up and still live near Main & 49th and though some Indian restaurants are no longer there, I would say by far, the food at Vij's is really the best. \xa0The real treat of the evening Chef Vikram Vij was there going from table to table thanking us for supporting local. \xa0We were the first table Chef came by and I noticed him immediately. \xa0 I helped my husband take a picture with Chef! \xa0We both ordered Thali which you choose 4 items (from appetizers and mains). \xa0So much to choose from! \xa0I choose: rainbow trout, tamarind and yogurt marinated and grilled chicken w/ salad, BC pork tenderloin and one more I can't remember (sorry!). \xa0Thali comes with rice and naan bread.The spices and flavour, oh my goodness, I can't describe it as it's so out of tis world! \xa0Though I don't like spicy food, some of the sauce as a bit too spicy however, I was able to power through. \xa0For dessert, we shared almond rice pudding and it was a nice end to our dinner at Vij's. \xa0We had an amazing time at Vij's.Support local as much as you can!"", ""Vij's is fusion food done right, this is the experience that's hard to replicate, they serve unique dishes that are not found elsewhere. In addition, they have created a unique ambiance that's one of the best for Indian restaurants. If you have not been there recently, know that they have not started taking reservations. Their covered patio upstairs is the perfect spot for Covid times."", ""We tried the pakoras, the chapatti and the Vegetable Curry with rice and naan. Everything was very good and authentic in taste. Especially the naan was very soft. My personal highlight was the Gulab Jamun that was sweet, soft and (most importantly!) served hot. The drinks were good, too. All in all a great Dinner. I will say though that I've had similarly good Indian food for a fraction of the cost. Is the food good? Yes. Is it worth the money? Well that depends. I'm inclined to believe that you're also in part paying for the location. The restaurant is beautiful, almost swanky. I heard good things about the terrace, too. If you're looking for a nice dining experience, you've come to the right place. If you simply want good food, you'll get it but it'll cost you."", ""Loved this place! First time here and was not disappointed. Staff is super friendly and I really loved the fact that Vij himself is always around checking in with all his customers.

I poured some of the syrup over all and it was really good. Washed it down with one of their house bloody marys.I also got a side of the meat loaf hash and to be honest it wasn't my thing.

He ordered the Chorizo Hash and I ordered Andy\'s Sage Fried Chicken and Eggs. (Who is Andy, anyway?!)Bacon mac and cheese: We both really enjoyed it but it was nothing out of the ordinary. Good, but not special. Chorizo Hash: My bf very much enjoyed it. The chorizo was absolutely delicious and the potatoes were great too! Although, I wouldn\'t call it a ""hash"". They were more like breakfast potatoes. The only thing this dish was missing was something refreshing, such as sour cream or pico de gallo. Andy\'s Sage Fried Chicken and Eggs: Chicken was cooked perfectly. Juicy, not dry, and the breading was not overwhelming. It was also drizzled with maple syrup. The griddled mash had great texture and flavor. The biscuit was the only item that was disappointing. It was dry and not as soft as it should be. As good as everything was individually, the dish was too heavy. It also needed something refreshing. All in all, this place is a good brunch spot. Massive portions, reasonable prices! Looking forward to coming here again and trying something new!', ""We love Hash House. We've been to one in Vegas so once we seen this in Orlando we had to go. We really enjoyed our Bloody Mary's.

The portions were good for the price, but I would prefer quality over quantity. We ordered food for take out, but I noticed the servers were dressed in traditional (I'm assuming?) outfits. I always appreciate dining in restaurants that provide a unique experience so perhaps if I give it another try we will dine in next time."", 'We stopped by for late dinner and just made it before their kitchen closed. Unfortunately, some customers were turned away five minutes after we had placed our order. It was just about 45 minutes before closing.

I like the aromatic coconut rice with my curry dishes but the pineapple fried rice was a good substitute. The satay skewers arrived first. The chicken and pork were nicely grilled. The peanut sauce was flavourful and not watered down. The curry and fried rice were a good portion size for the price. There was a decent amount of prawns in the sweet red curry. I like that there were fresh pineapple slices on the fried rice. The staff really wanted to go home that we were not offered a dessert menu.Overall, the food was worth four stars.

"['Each one of the stars above represents 1000 stars each. Maybe 2000. This is the coolest most original Ethiopian place in town. Comparable only to Addis Ababa.

Had all the sides and they were the best. Especially the greens and lentils. Bombdiggity. We had all the entrees but the doro watt and the alicha begg wott were like hugs from momma. 3 sides per platter should give you and your babydoll plenty of experimenting.

I really enjoyed the spicy lentils and the spinach and the eggplant. The injera was very sour in my opinion though. Overall the staff are really kind and I left very full.If you come for the lunch buffet it's such a good deal. only $13!"", ""I've ordered takeout from Aster's a few times and had consistently good experiences. I've been particularly impressed with how well their food travels given the relatively messy nature of Ethiopian food.For those who haven't had Ethiopian food before, or are just not super familiar with the offerings, I think this is a great place to start. Their combination platters give a wide variety of flavors and the descriptions make it very clear what kind of flavor you're in for if you have a sensitive palate. Even if you only order a dish designed for an individual, each entree comes with two or three side dishes, so you're able to get a fairly diverse experience. The dishes I've enjoyed the most are Doro Wott (spicy chicken), Alicha Begg Wott (termeric lamb), and Alicha Miser (mild garlic lentils, absolute must try for one of your vegetable options). There have certainly been some misses, I didn't love the Kitfo (steak tartare) and people I've dined with have found a significant proportion of the dishes to be too spicy for their taste, but I'm sure the staff can help point you in the right direction if that's a concern.I haven't dined in, but the last time I picked up from them the indoor seating looked pretty comfortable and they've opened up quite a bit more seating since earlier in the pandemic. The one downside I've experienced with them is the pick up time estimates are not a great indicator of when your food will be available. I've had times where it was ready when I arrived, and others when I've been stuck standing in the restaraunt for quite a while. Not a big enough issue to ding them a star, but certainly worth keeping in mind"", 'Last time I had eithiopian food was 5 years ago in LA. This place is a small restaurant off I-35 close to campus.

It would be nice if they had music playing. When we entered, the server seemed really hesitant, and I felt like we weren't supposed to be there.

Mistakes were made. Once we saw the menu, our stress from driving through rush hour traffic and searching for parking evaporated. I don't know how anyone can browse their menu without salivating heavily. Their menu is extensive with everything from various land and sea animals, vegetables, pizzas, pastas, and desserts. \xa0My favourite item was their buttermilk fried chicken. I was really hesitant to order fried chicken at a restaurant like this, but our server told us it was the most popular item on the menu. I completely understand why. It's the BEST fried chicken I've ever had. Every piece is boneless, meaty, crunchy, perfectly seasoned. The bit of maple syrup sauce elevate each bite to perfection.The clam pasta with white wine sauce was delicious, as well. The sauce was garlicky and had such a depth of flavour that the dish didn't need any bells and whistles. I would have preferred it slightly less salty though.The baba ganoush was a tasty way to start the meal. It essentially tasted like the best hummus I've ever tried, although I am no expert. The dip would have been better served warm rather than cold, however.Finally, we had the pork cheek, which was alright, but it was overall a greasy dish and the flavours weren't that remarkable.I would definitely come back to have the fried chicken and try from their many other menu items!"", ""Highly recommend trying to make reservations in advance as this restaurant is very popular for good reason.

From the warm service to the delicious food, nearly everything about it was perfect.We tried a puebla-something cocktail which sounded good on paper but was watery and boring in reality. For food, we started with the cauliflower which I found forgettable, wishing that it had been more roasted. Thankfully, the rest of the dishes were so good that it made up for a rocky start. The chorizo pizza was some of the best I've had in Canada - the crust and sauce were perfectly balanced from a flavour and texture perspective. The clam spaghetti was wonderful as well. And the arctic char, while not the prettiest, was delicious and delicate."", ""Nightingale is the sister company of Hawksworth, boasting a seasonal menu and upscale ambiance at a price point slightly easier on the wallet. Hands down, you must order the Halibut Ceviche ($19) and Buttermilk Fried Chicken ($18) as starters. The ceviche offers a delightful array of flavours and textures, with its fresh cubes of halibut, diced tomatoes, creamy avocado, crisp plantain chips, and a splash of citrus juice to awaken the taste buds. Though the halibut shone through, it was the plantain chips that provided the creative spin to such a popular dish. Speaking of popular, the fried chicken at Nightingale deserves all the accolades because it ranks as some of the best fried chicken I have ever had in my life. Aside from the wonderfully crunchy batter and the tender chicken, what seals the deal is the ingenious blend of spiced maple syrup and sumac, a tangy spice that I need more of in my life. As if that weren't enough, there are also some sliced pickles to give you the ultimate flavour profile. For our mains, my friend and I ordered the Radiatore ($18 half, $25 full) and Roasted Pork Belly ($29). While these still tasted good, we couldn't help but agree that the starters were the best part of our meal. The radiatore was quite heavy, though I did appreciate how the ruffled pasta provided nooks and crannies for the lamb ragu to tuck itself into. The pork belly portion was smaller than I expected and also not the dish I was expecting based on previous Yelp reviews. Given Nightingale's farm to table concept, apricots, pickled mustard seeds, and BBQ sauce accompanied the dish rather than apples, pistachios, and a bourbon glaze. The roasted pork belly was reminiscent of Chinese roast pork belly, with its crunchy pork rind and its fatty cut of meat. The BBQ sauce was a tad too sweet for my liking though.With its high ceilings, wooden paneling, and brass accents, Nightingale is the perfect venue to celebrate a special occasion. The service was also lovely both during and after our visit. Our server offered recommendations and checked in on us from time to time. When I noticed an error on our bill after leaving, Tori from reception kindly arranged for the difference to be refunded. Given the sophisticated flair of the restaurant, I would recommend dressing at least business casual. Also, do make reservations as we were given a 1.5-hour waiting time when we came in at 7pm on a Tuesday night. Overall, Nightingale offers a pleasant dining experience with its spectacular food, service, and ambiance. It may be pricier than your average meal, but it is certainly worth the visit, if only for the heavenly fried chicken alone."", ""Great food!!!From the outside this restaurant is gorgeous as it is currently decorated with flowers. When you step in you will be greeted right away. The restaurant is big and 2 floors. Buttermilk chicken was great. The right amount of crunch and a delicious sweet/salty mix. Pair this with the sweet potato dish and you have an amazing meal. I also ordered the flatiron steak which I feel is a must-have as well. The flavor is good and the mushrooms are a nice touch. Also ordered their margharitta pizza and a pale ale and Pilsen. I suggest going for happy hour. Or even just catching the end of it. I made a reservation 2 weeks ahead online and got the 5:15 slot. It was a perfect time for a Friday. It wasn't very busy and you could still enjoy your conversation. Towards the end of the dinner it got a little bit louder as more people dined in. Can't wait to be back and try even more!"", 'Truly worthy of my 5 stars. The food, service, and ambiance were fantastic. When we arrived, they did not have a table for us but the hostess went out of her way to accommodate. When the waitress came to the table, she was so friendly and warm.

We got the Playboy sandwich, with a side of mac n cheese. Prices have increased due to COVID, but they were still pretty reasonable! Portions however, were massive. The sandwich we had was absolutely loaded with meat. Sausage was good, brisket was good, and I think the other meat was pulled pork. Only thing I wished it had was just a little bit more BBQ sauce, but other than that - pretty good! Mac n cheese was alright, but complemented the sandwich really well. Service was quick and courteous, so this place definitely comes recommended!', 'Very underwhelmed. Decent pork and vegetarian sandwiches but certainly not worth the cost, and the truck itself was not in a particularly nice area for outdoor dining.

Probably a good late night option, but would not recommend for lunch.', 'Okay Y\'all. We discovered this gem when a friend visiting from Monterey, CA wanted BBQ and didn\'t want to wait in line at other BBQ places. So I used my trusty Yelp app and found Rollin Smoke. I love the name btw.The brisket and pork belly sandwiches....yes, please. The smokey flavor combined with whatever rub they use was amazing. The smoked mac and cheese was great.

I called in an order later in the day, and while Rollin Smoke was running a bit low on supplies, they were able to put together some brisket and pulled pork tacos for me. Star. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?$5.00 for a brisket taco is perfect, especially if, as was the case here, they're filling the thing up with what seemed to be at least a quarter pound of brisket or pulled pork. Star. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?These were good tacos both brisket and pulled pork. I'm a brisket purist at heart, and the flavor here was good in addition to the crust that delivered a particular satisfying crunch when dished up in taco form. My only gripe here if you can call it that is that the tortilla was on the weak side and I could have used with some sort of peripherals in the mix be that peppers or onions or something of the like just to make it something more than brisket and a bit of sauce wrapped in a tortilla. Single Star. Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?Definitely. Rollin Smoke delivers. Star."", ""When ever is an Austin foodtruck ever bad when it has lasted beyond a few months?

Unfortunately, it took over 20 minutes and 2 broken glasses (not my drink) to get this $14 drink. I felt so badly for the guy, who wants to break one glass, let alone 2.

Drink orders simple, but just got the coldest of shoulders. We weren't complicated, several repeat orders.

The food was fantastic though and my eggs benedict was made correctly.The second time I came here (December 2017), we came for the dinner service and ended up sitting inside with a group of my friends. The service was fantastic this time but the downside was that the beef hash was super salty. Unfortunately, most of us ordered the beef hash dish...This is the result of the most recent time I went (July 2018):The Service: This time, the service was fantastic. Our drinks were brought out promptly and the waitress checked up on us multiple times to make sure we were good.The food:EGGS BENEDICT: The eggs benedict looked FANTASTIC, however, when I cut into the eggs, I found out they were not runny at all. Other than that, the dish tasted great. Even with the overcooked eggs.CRISPY PORK FLAUTAS: This is something I have never seen on the menu before which a party member of mine ordered. The flautas were great and they had just the right crispy texture to make it a top choice of mine.QUINOA: I've never really dabbled in the quinoa world and it's not really something I would order as my top choice, however, they made a fantastic quinoa dish. It was so impressive that the next time I go to brunch here, I will probably order it. If they still have it on the menu...The Drinks:You can't really go wrong with the drinks. We ordered 2 carafe's of mimosas, however, instead of them mixing them, we asked them to put the juices (orange and grapefruit) in another cup so we can mix them ourselves.All in all, I'm not too sure what to make of this place yet.

"[""So I was going to be in Austin for a week with LRoth and this place kept popping up on all the blogs and suggestions for places to eat in Austin. So this place was to the north of downtown but not quite campus. It appeared to be a repurposed home. The inside gave it an intimate home yet modern feeling. I'd recommend a reservation since it was packed even on a Tuesday night. The menu rotates based on season and availability from what I'm told but there are some staples. We started with gulf shrimp and Jefferson red rice as an app. Shrimp was cooked well. The rice was something else though. Perfect mix of tobasco and butter to give it some creaminess but able to maintain the texture of the red rice. Not overwhelming with the spice either. Even LRoth who can't even handle a drop of Sriracha was able to tackle this dish. For entrees, I got the braised beef cheeks with grits. The grits were perfectly cooked to my desired creaminess. The beef cheeks reminded me of barbacoa. Nicely seasoned and so so so tender. The addition of parsley oil give it a nice refreshing fragrance. LRoth ended up getting a stuffed chicken breast. Chicken was juicy. The stuffing was cooked with bacon fat to elevate the stuffing game. There was a mushroom gravy using more woody mushrooms, which I appreciated, especially when I'm not the biggest mushroom fan. For dessert, we ended up getting a Kentucky butter cake and a chocolate strawberry icebox cake. Both were so delicious. Cake was moist for both. The icing was on the icebox cake wasn't overpowering at all. All in all, this is a place I'd highly recommend."", 'My claim of ""my favorite Austin restaurant"" had started to feel stale, not having been since before the pandemic. Praise renewed and oh so worthy! To those complaining about pricing (or their ""fair wage"" approach to billing), the interwebs and Yelp reviews give fair warning: this isn\'t the place for you (especially if you view tip as a justified way to reduce your final bill). This is a place you go with abandon and a paid-down credit card!The elegant, southern-contemporary space is the perfect backdrop for impeccable yet unfussy service and exquisitely prepared and presented dishes (how does one make cabbage, butter beans, or sweet potatoes THAT amazing???)It\'s true, it will add up fast - especially with cocktails - as the openers and sides are not large, but the reward is a delectable meal that - if planned right - will leave you plenty satisfied, though not roll-out-the-door full nor with a doggie bag. My best experiences have been with one other person and an agreement to share: an opener, an entree, and one side per person - then divvy and celebrate all that deliciousness. This is a modern interpretation of southern comfort-food - if you don\'t let cost overwhelm the experience, the precise, clever preparation and quality ingredients assure a wonderful experience you will want again and again for the right occasion.', ""We came in during the Valentine's Day menu. I was quite disappointed with the food and pricing. The menu consisted of 3 courses for 115$ per person. I opted for the vegetarian option. I thought the first course of butter beans was very good but not spectacular. The second course - a cauliflower dish was over-seasoned with salt, but even overlooking that, I didn't think it was worth the price. Unfortunately I was able to finish only half of it due to the high salt content. Desserts were amazing and I would highly recommend them. We had a cucumber sorbet and some sort of a vanilla chocolate mousse I believe. Both were really high quality and delicious. The biscuits were absolutely SPECTACULAR. The honey butter served with the biscuits was amazing. The service was impeccable and flawless. Our waiter, Kurt K (name on receipt) is possibly the nicest person I've met in Austin. Really 6 star service!!! The menu states that to every check, there is a 20% employee wellness charge that gets added on. If you also tip 20% that's 40% added to every check in additional charges. I think adding almost 1/2 of your check amount in extra charges is quite crazy and frankly out of touch with reality, for a restaurant to do. Our dinner came out to 427$ (with tip) and we didn't order any alcoholic drinks. I later went on their website and added the prices of all the items I ate if I paid for them a la carte vs through the prix fixe menu. The butter bean dish was $14, cauliflower $38, the exact dessert wasn't on the menu but desserts in general are around $12, biscuits with butter $3. That's $67. I paid $115. That is a $48 dollar difference. I'm not sure how the restaurant arrived at this highly elevated price. Again, desserts & biscuits were amazing and the service was most likely the best service I've received to date. Kurt is such a genuine and warm person. He really made our evening and we talked about how great he was on the way home. I don't know if the restaurant just had a weird night when we came... not sure what the reason for our experience was especially considering the other reviews. I would be willing to perhaps give it another chance, but definitely not during a prix fixe menu night."", 'Olamaie is really good but not perfect. The place is very cute and romantic. It is rather loud, so it can be a bit difficult to have a quiet conversation. The cocktails were very nice and the first course items we had, smoked beef belly & shrimp w/ red rice were amazing. The biscuits are also crave worthy. The main entrees we tried were good but could have been a bit better. The grilled pork chop was nice and thick but a little over cooked. The beef cheeks were nice but the grits were a bit lumpy and the tomato sauce was kind of bland. The sweet potato side was also amazing. \xa0The service was great and I would go back. Next time I would just order some first course items, biscuits, and sides. Their portion sizes are really good.', ""We went in for their special Valentine's Day dinner so I can only comment on that and not the normal daily menu. In summary, the dinner was AMAZING. Was it expensive? Yes. Was it worth it? Also yes. Every single course was delicious and not something run of the mill that we would just order anywhere. The pictures speak for themselves.

A standard case of ""eyes bigger than my stomach."" Also probably because I ate one of their AMAZING buttermilk biscuits, too (lol). Boyfriend ordered had the blackened grouper that came with this blue crab cream sauce that was definitely made in heaven. His entree was better than mine. Third course: drunken fruit cake!

"[""Typical bar food, but the service is really quick during lunch, but I usually sit at the bar. A $3 off coupon for any item got me to come and visit twice in a week. I really like that they keep updating their menu. They added a $5 lunch menu too, which is ok. I don't recommend their pork barrel sandwich, the pork was way overdone!The best two new things on their menu are the grilled/roasted wings (delish and healthy!!) and their grilled chicken sandwich with pesto."", ""Woot, there it is, at my door!!

Stay tuned . . ."", ""Loco's is great for drinking, but not really impressed with their food. We go to Loco's a lot for trivia and have a few drinks while we are there. The beer is cheap for Atlanta and Buckhead, so that is always a plus with me. As far as food, I've never been impressed with Loco's food. It is average bar food. So when it was suggested that we have lunch at Loco's today I was not the happiest camper; but I agreed to go since we had the dogs and could sit on the patio. The food as usual was average, but the service was awful. It was the worst service I've had at any restaurant in a very long time. Our waiter came out and acted as if he were doing us a favor to wait on us. He took our drink order and came back with the drinks to take our food order. Then he brought our food out. We didn't see him again until after we finished eating and it was time for our check. We could both have used a drink refill halfway through the meal, but instead got no service. That is why this Loco's gets a 3 star rating today."", ""They will serve you burnt food while they nickle and \xa0dime you. We were charged extra for ranch dressing which we subbed.

I mean, I'd probably still pick Taco Mac over it, but it would have been a good place to change it up. I had a Cobb Salad, boyfriend and a couple others had quesadillas, and some of the others had tenders. Everything was good - the quesadilla had a good kick (jalapenos in it), which is just how boyfriend likes it. Everyone said the tenders were really good. The salad came with way too much dressing, but luckily it was on the side so there was some extra sauce for the tenders. I really enjoyed it - lots of greens, lots of chicken, and just the right amounts of everything else.All in all, a solid 3 stars. But I never set foot in the place, so that's based on food alone."", ""Yuck, Yuck, Yuck.....Blechhh.I ordered delivery from Locos at 11:30. I was told the order would be delivered by 12:25.

The food here is always mediocre, off temperature, and bland. This time I brought in a crew of 11 people on a Friday afternoon. Service sucked and was virtually non-existent. I was actually pissed gratuity was automatically added, because she didn't deserve it AT ALL. I ordered the Blackened Rooster, which came out not blackened, and the chicken was dry and chewy. Others had similar experiences. Barely warm wings, mediocre food, and cold fries. And did I mention how bad the service was? Sadly, I won't get fooled again. (And I'm being generous with two stars.)"", ""You know, you hope someone gives this place the wake up call that they need. I mean, this is round 2 in the same location for them. They should have it figured out by now. They've got all the right stuff to be great, and they're just, frankly, terrible. I mean how can you mess up standard bar food, like fries and chicken fingers. I constantly am drawn to this place, for its location, its delivery options, and the thought that it might be the fried food I'd been hankering for, but I'm so constantly left dissapointed.

For the portions, it was just slightly pricier than others but the location was convenient. Felt compelled to write a review for two reasons. One to just log where not to try again, and two because of the following:They stapled the takeout bag so I didn't realize that they provided about six packs of soy sauce for a small order but the tiniest piece of wasabi that is barely sufficient for even two sushi pieces. What really triggered though was biting into a small stone (or whatever it was) from a nigiri. It was enough where it would have you running to the mirror to make sure the tooth didn't chip. It didn't. With minimal attention to basic details, it wasn't surprising that the sashimi and the chef's pick on the roll also tasted subpar.

(2) earlier in the day, the mgmt cancelled our Igloo reservation and claimed it was for 4:30pm when we did it for 6. Food & service were great so we'd like to go again. Before that, we'd need Management to fix their cash register so it totals bills correctly and they figure out how to accurately share reservation times with their Host staff.

Helped us pick drinks - Pineapple Margaritas (actual pineapple instead of mix), Cherry Whiskey Smash (great flavor and strong), and was enthusiastic about taking care of us in the igloo amidst a windy Atlanta January night. The Wasabi Burger and California burrito are good.We reserved an Igloo on their website (ultimately on OpenTable). Guaranteed with a credit card and $100 2ppl no-show fee, we figured we were good. But, we show up to find out they cancelled it and thought it was booked at 4:30 instead of 6pm. We showed the opentable app still showed us having a 6pm 1/28 reservation. After 10 mins of correcting the info mgmt had given them, the hosts eloquently straightened it out and got us into an Igloo. Side note, another reviewer had issues calling to reserve an Igloo. It's frustrating that both online and phone reservations have ended up being cancelled according to what management told the Hosts.During the meal, the manager came by and just acknowledged there's been a mixup with our reservation. Malik did a far superior job making it right by being chill the whole evening and even giving us a huge sparkler sundae.We get the bill and it seemed closed enough. It was off by $12. Seems small, but it's due to two errors with their cash register instead of getting charged for food or drink not ordered. The cash register added a discount to the bill instead of subtracting it. Worse, the subtotal didn't match adding up the line items above it. Got home and glanced as I was going to toss it. The discount increased the subtotal from $96 to $103. Malik was a great server, the Igloo was fun, and food and drinks were great. \xa0Before we go again, we'd need to know Management had fixed their cash register to add up bills right and they accurately share times of igloo reservations with their hosts."", 'Came by to try this out and loved it!

More korean goods than Chinese. If I need Chinese groceries I go to 99 Ranch. But Hana world still has some essentials. Their sliced meat is actually pretty good and fresh. Priced better than newer and cleaner Hmart. I have never bought seafood here and sometimes this place doesn't smell clean either that or overly clean with cleaners but I know they try their best.

"['Here\'s a throwback review to pre-pandemic times when we weren\'t scared to be in throngs of people waiting in line for drinks that came in flashing, lightbulb-shaped containers. I first read about the Richmond Night Market in a NY Times article entitled ""The Best Asian Food in North America? Try British Columbia"" (2018). From that point on, I dreamed of going to the night market but it took several months before I had the chance. Before the pandemic, I went back 2 or 3 more times--the last time with more family so we could introduce them to the night market experience. Yes, the lines are long and you save by buying the tickets in packs. I\'ve seen strangers getting together to buy the packs and save money, but the savings wasn\'t substantial enough for us to do that. The line is long way before the market opens, and once it does, it seems like slow-going until you\'re finally inside. But once inside it\'s like swap meet meets carnival meets foodie heaven. The marketplace really is a glorified swap meet with lots of cheap pens, blankets, weird makeup, and toys. But we still walk around to look at everything. There\'s a play section with dinosaurs for the kids and a stage for performances. And there are rows and rows of food booths featuring highly Instagrammable food like rainbow grilled cheese sandwiches and churros in tiny unicorn floaties. It was the first place I saw butterfly pea protein turn milk tea blue, the first place I tried dragon\'s beard candy (i saw it made too!), and the first place I ate a giant, paper-thin fish cake/wafer thingy. I have good memories of the night market and luckily those aren\'t overshadowed by the incredibly long lines, the masses of people, and the poor dogs that idiots bring into the market (Seriously. Nobody sees them. It\'s easy for them to get stepped on or worse, and it\'s just sensory overload for them. Leave them at home.). The downside to the market is the crowds, the lines, the high cost of food, and the drunken, disrespectful people who treat it like some sort of exotic buffet. My advice is to come early, check the board for the most popular items, have a game plan (for instance, if there are 4 of you, each of you can stand in line for a different dish to try and meet in a designated area to eat together), and get out before things get too overrun. Not being able to go to Canada was difficult these past two years. I hope things improve with the pandemic and we\'re able to visit the night market again in 2022.', ""Detroit doesn't have one of these. It's a street food festival every weekend. Yes please! I adore places like these. Where I can shop and get my grub on at the same time. Plus this spot has been in my bucket list for a while. It's also a great place to hang with friends and family. There are tons of options for food, there's also live entertainment and good people everywhere. I believe we hit up 4 different stalls until we were pretty much super full from all that good food. Only thing I wish is alco beverages, but I still had a good time even tho. I would totally recommend it to anyone who loves street food and a good time. I can't wait to be back.Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"", 'A long time ago, I remember visiting the Richmond Night Market about 20 years ago (gasp, when it all started).. it was a small affair, with just a few vendors and maybe an amusement park thing or two. \xa0I recall looking at trinkets thinking, gee.. that\'s pretty unique, let\'s get it. \xa0Well earned money for something neat. \xa0Forward to 2021. New era, it\'s the middle of a pandemic. \xa0Yet, it\'s happening. \xa0I\'ve been coming to the night market, let\'s say every few years now, and it\'s not the same. \xa0It\'s bigger... but not necessarily better? \xa0Let me take you on the journey, and you can decide. Firstly, there is an app.. which you can buy a ticket to skip the line.. except you have to buy them in packs. \xa0Will I use every ticket, nope... but will in stand in line that wraps around the fenceline of the event.. nope. \xa0So there goes money to get in. \xa0Next, it\'s hard to figure out at first what is really going on here... because there are massive ""wall-to-wall"" crowds. \xa0 I mean, I heard on the overhead that they are limiting the number of people there, but if this was limited, then what is normal? \xa0Oh, parking is free, and when I got there, there was plenty of it. As you walk from the entrance forward, you are instantly surrounded by bazaar vendors, selling what I could only call, mass market things. \xa0I was so wanting to see a vendor that was offering something that they created.. that they made. \xa0Instead, I saw no less than 4 vendors offering cellphone cases/screen protectors. \xa0I did see a few shops with things that maybe they made.. but I couldn\'t really tell. \xa0As we rounded end of the main walkway, the redeeming part of the event was now visible.. the food. \xa0Cash is king here... for reasons which I assume like ""fight club"" you don\'t talk about. \xa0Which honestly, whatever... except the location of the ATMs and their usability is likely the worst ever. \xa0If you design a festival and have food stalls that only take cash, then put those things EVERYWHERE. \xa0 Also, it might be helpful to advertise on the website that you should bring a pocket full of cash. \xa0I would have literally spend lots of money, if not for the fact that the ATMs were fail-whale, and the lines for everything edible was longer than my hair during my ninkyō dantai days. The three stars is because the food, once you figure out to pay for it, is delicious, albeit overpriced for the quantity you get. \xa0What I did end up getting was tasty. \xa0The lines were long, and the line control at one of the food sections was more like a standing at the VIP door of a club, and not being VIP. \xa0There was also a small section with two strength based amusement activities, which has a small crowd cheering. \xa0I didn\'t see what it was, but seems to be an oversized mallet challenge, and separately a hanging in the air challenge. \xa0 Lastly, there was also a stage for what I assume was for music and dance acts. \xa0So overall, yeah, so that happened. \xa0Would I come back again, maybe.', ""For this year, I was glad that the Richmond night market did open. I went there two weeks when it opened and two weeks before closing. For a change compared from the past year's zoom pass is now only purchased online, more security at the food area to control the flow of people, and there are sinks for handwashing. Due to the pandemic, it can't be denied that there are still risks while at the market, but people do try to wear a mask while not eating and try to distance themselves from each other, and I can see most vendors are all wearing gloves and mask.Four things I love about the market are the food stalls, stall shops, carnival games, and some performances on the stage. Foods, I'm a big fan of their food area; I love the variety of different food stalls in one place; yea the foods and are honestly pricey, but still, many are generously served, and you will forget it once you were able to buy that food your craving. Stall shops, lots of retail to look at, from accessories to snacks to some Asian goods that are sometimes hard to purchase online or find in stores. Some are a good deal; some are not but the fact that you can see and buy it there right away instead of purchasing online. Carnival games and rides, they don't have much of the rides this year, but still, there are some that children can enjoy. Games are entertaining and challenging, and every year, there are new games. Stage performances, when done eating and shopping and you want a little rest, the stage is an excellent spot to hang out, they do have some chairs if you're going to sit and watch some fantastic performances from talented people and different cultural performances from mostly \xa0Asian country like Vietnam, Taiwan, Philippines and others.Lastly, the night market has a dinosaur theme which you can spot the giant dinosaur and many dinosaurs around the market, which I see lots of children adore and take a selfie with."", ""Loved this on warm summer nights! Too bad we weren't able to cross over before they were closed for the season! Alas, next year we will return! This is the only consistent night market open in summer on the west coast and possibly in all of North America. Yummy food/drink vendors and vendors selling knick-knacks fill every corner of this Richmond space. It is a small taste of what night markets look like in Taiwan. I look forward to returning the next chance I get!"", ""Best market by far! Never let down and food is amazing. I don't mind the waits and it's so worth it."", ""Went there on a Saturday night. Food were a bit overpriced but tasted good overall. It was so crowded which may not be practical for this year since we're still in a pandemic."", ""Prior to going to this night market the only other ones I'd been to were in Toronto and Markham. Those pale in comparison for their size, selection and atmosphere. Originally we were lining up to get in but decided to pay to skip the line. We found a couple other people to form a group and split the price of the pass. Since it's so popular one of the downsides are the lines at every single food stall. The food makes it all worthwhile though. I wish there were more bar height tables around to facilitate in a better eating experience."", 'This night market makes most of the food festivals in the U.S look pretty SAD... Established in 2000, The Richmond Night Market must be the pioneer of all night markets, because this has become a popular destination whether you\'re a local or tourist in the Richmond area.SIDE NOTE:**THE NIGHT MARKET SEASON FOR 2019 HAS ALREADY ENDED. IT WAS ON ALL WEEKENDS FROM MAY 10 THROUGH OCTOBER 14**This night market has had various locations throughout the years, but has been in their current location since 2012. Getting there is very easy. Take the Canada Line all the way to Bridgeport, \xa0then follow the signs to the night market, about a 5-10 minute walk. We had a pretty good position in the GENERAL LINE, But honestly, the ZOOM PASS LINE is where you wanna be. For $28 dollars, the zoom pass is good for 6 people, and you\'ll get access into the night market before the general admission line. Luckily for us, a local woman came over to the general admission line where we were, looking for a couple of people to fill her zoom pass, and immediately I got her attention and said ""We\'ll do it!"" before anyone else could answer. Snooze, you lose! ;)Luckily, the woman who we jumped on the zoom pass with and her buddies had up front positions in the zoom pass line, \xa0because as the time got nearer to opening, \xa0the zoom pass \xa0line grew to just as large as the general admission line! We got in at 7pm and went straight to the food vendors.**Now keep in mind the fact that we did a Thomas Haas MEGA DESSERT/PASTRY breakfast and another MEGA LUNCH MARATHON at Granville Island before coming here!**  Here are the delicious dishes we demolished with the stomach space we had left:MAC-A-ROTI & CHEESE WITH BACON-JALAPEÑO DRIZZLE from Mamak-LaCRISPY GARLIC \xa0CHICKEN SKINS SALMON AND AHI CRISPY NORI TACOS from Nori Express MANGO MOCHI FREEZE from Mango Yummy THAI TEA PANNA COTTA WITH SQUID INK DOK JOK from Tuk Tuk These were delicious!!! The disappointments of the night were the MANGO-COCONUT DUCK PUDDING and DONUT POPSICLE from Angel Duck Cafe. These were good examples of food fails, or ""Instagrammable Food"" (food items that look and sound better than they taste, and items that foodies will post on their IG for likes and followers. I should have known better, \xa0but it is what it is...We were done with the dining segment, \xa0so the rest of the time we checked out all the cool shop vendors and entertainment until about 10 pm. Some great takeaways from this event :Very clean, massive space regardless of the crowds(more like a controlled chaos)Variety of food offerings- definitely something for everyone NIGHT MARKET HAPPY HOUR, 10-11pmAll food vendors slash their prices the last \xa0hour of the night market, and because of this, there was still a LONNNNNNG line of people trying to get in when we left at 10pm**other night markets need to do this!**Games/entertainment/non-food vendors galore, \xa0no shortage of seating/lounging areas(Vegas food festivals and night markets charge a $50 VIP fee for lounging areas-BOO!) Very well maintained public restrooms The overall sense of community at this event-everyone is just enjoying the event with \xa0friends and family, \xa0 different races, colors, and creeds cordial with one another, \xa0and no fights or misbehaving people around. Definitely somewhere I\'d be looking to return in the future. Thanks for a great time Richmond Night Market!

Even if you're not a big foodie... GO! We planned a whole trip to Canada around it and I have no regrets.There's so many food and drink options here that it's overwhelming. There's so much to try! It's a good idea to go with a group of friends, so you can all buy different things and take bites of everything. I don't have the biggest stomach so it's hard for me to eat copious amounts (even though I want to so bad).Some standouts to me that I tried were the ramen stand (I'm the worst for not remembering the name), and the Nori Express sushi tacos. The ramen I got was a spicy miso with a great broth. For like $8, you get a FULL bowl which is a steal! The sushi tacos were the highlight for me. There's spicy tuna, salmon, and Cali style. I was so dang full that I just went with Cali style, because that didn't seem like it would be too overwhelming on my full belly. It was SO good. I wish I wasn't full... I could've had like three of those things.Outside of food and drinks, there's other stuff to do here, too! There's games, play areas for kids, shopping, and performances. It's a full-fledged FESTIVAL. I absolutely loved this experience. I'll be back sometime again!""]",negative
"[""Solid place to eat at for dinner. The decor is quite nice and the service was great. For starters we had the pea soup. This was excellent. Nice broth, not too thick and I think they deep fried the large chunks of pork belly. Man that was over the top. High recommend. For the entree we had their special which was steak, salmon, shrimp, veggies and salad for $42/person ($84 total). The steak had a great taste (not too salty...seasoning was just right). Our steak was slightly over cooked though. We asked for med rare and it was medium well. Salmon was perfect! My fav of the dish. Shrimp was good as cooked perfectly as well. We went in a Wednesday and wine is 40% off so of course we had a bottle of wine! All in all we enjoyed ourselves \xa0I'd recommend this location."", ""Used to love this place. Not any more.To be fair, I used to go at lunch time and it was pleasant. Went for dinner and didn't realize it turns into one of those bars where the rock music is not only played but played loudly. I asked the waitress to please change the music or put the volume down and she said she would.But she didn't.Sorry, you can't appeal to one sense -- taste -- and do a good job on it but butcher me on another, sound."", ""Was excited to try the Flying Pig as I've heard good things about it for years now. Unfortunately, it seems as they've expanded to multiple locations their quality has also gone done. Service was ok but not the most friendly.We got the crab and shrimp cakes and they weren't anything special. Didn't have enough crab or shrimp and I tasted mostly batter.The bone marrow was good but it needed a carb to go with it. The short rib lacked flavour. It had a hint of red wine from the braising sauce, but I don't think there was even salt on it. It also wasn't tender. The vegetables it came with was undercooked. The best part of the dish was definitely the cheese mashed potatoes.My boyfriend got the crusted coho salmon (not pictured) and it was fishy and also overcooked. We got a new one and it was medium rare. The texture was a lot better but it was still fishy (leads me to think the fish was frozen)."", ""Everything was delicious but our waitress was very sassy. She made the good food taste mediocre with her service. She came by our table once during dinner and we asked for water and she never returned, until it was time to give us the check. I will not recommend this location to anyone who'd like to be treated nicely"", ""I didn't get to try The Flying Pig the first time I visited Vancouver, but was so excited to finally try it out this time around. There were plenty of paid street parking near the restaurant by a park and was a quick walk over. We definitely came during off hours around 4pm so the restaurant was basically empty. I had their bone marrow dish with carrots and mashed potatoes (4/5), their clams (6/5) it was soooo good and my favorite dish, and lobster risotto (5/5) was also delicious. It def meets the hype and I would def come back if I were visiting again. I also appreciated their very attentive customer service as they kept checking in with us."", ""Upon entering, this place was a little busy. There were mostly groups of people with their friends hanging out for happy hour. It seemed like a good choice if you wanted a good dinner and a drink with the meal. We stumbled upon this place during the awkward transition between happy hour and dinner. I was with my mom and we felt a little rushed to choose between both menus. Finally, when we ordered we didn't expect for the food to come so fast. Our service was friendly and they made sure we got what we needed to make our experience memorable. The coffee was not as smooth as I expected, but it was still pretty good. So, I slipped away waiting for our meal. The truffle fries came out and we made a hole chatting and picking at it. It was very tasteful and quite crunchy. I'd say, it was pretty good. Finally, when the food came we started with the Ahi Tuna + quinoa. It was what I'd say, it was the best thing I've had here. The veal came up next and I was a little disappointed. Not a lot of flavour, although the meat was tender. Maybe my mom and I chose the wrong thing? We decided to stick with these two mains until we got full. I've walked this place for years and been wanting to try it forever and when I finally did, it was a little underwhelming for me. Although, it could have been the time of the day and the kind of food we chose? I'll keep this place at the back of my mind and will be sure to try again!"", 'I really enjoyed my lunch at this cozy little place in beautiful Yaletown, Vancouver today!They have a great selection on their menu and their lunch prices are reasonable. What really stood out for me was their warm, attentive and professional service. From the beginning to the end. The host made us feel very welcome and our server took very good care of us the whole time. Due to the winter wonderland feel and all the snow I felt I need to start things off with a nice cup of coffee. I loved the coffee. It was JJ Bean and piping hot and served in a sparkling cup.....exactly the way I like it. We had the Pulled Pork Sandwich and the Chicken cutlets.I loved the pulled pork, juicy and well seasoned with a nice crisp fresh ceasar salad and a slice of gherkin with the meal which was a nice touch. I love gherkins!I also tried the Chicken cutlet which was beautifully cooked. Tender with the batter seasoned just on point and the mash was a perfect pairing.

Great staff! Great food & lively place overall!"", ""I went here with friends, and so far it was an okay experience. The staff was amiable as we were kind of late for our reservation, but gladly, we were still able to get our seats. The waiter who assisted us was as well very friendly keeps coming back to ask and help us with what to order, we ended up ordering their special steak platter which is $49 for each person. It comes with 14 oz steak, ahi tuna, salad, seasonal veggies, corn salsa, risotto and chorizo. The food was really good, steak was juicy and tender, ahi tuna was so tasty. I think it's the one that stays on my mind; the salad was fresh and great amount; risotto was not a favourite, hoping for more veggies. So far, it was an excellent meal, just one star less cause; for some reason, my male friends said they were not full like the meal was not enough for them. Especially that its $49 per person. At the same time, it was loud; I understood that everyone was chatting, but it was deafening that my friends and I decided to go somewhere else for drinks and desserts to talk better. I would still consider coming back here and maybe trying their other menus and maybe not with the platter.Minus one more star- I like that the staff were friendly, but honestly, they were not that strict in checking Covid id, did not scan, and I was the one to initiate to show my ID."", 'My husband and I had a very good dinner at the Yaletown location. Excellent service, all the staff was very nice. We ordered the cod and the braised short rib and both dishes were very tasty. Nice cozy vibe, perfect for a Saturday date night.

We ordered straight from the kitchen a salt pepper deep-fried fish head, steamed scallops, and their famous black peppercorns Dungeness crab.

We will come back soon!', 'This is a local authentic Chinese hotpot place. No gimmicky all you can eat, but fresh ingredients. BYOB friendly Crowded so best to make reservations and go during off hours \xa0Parking at the back', 'Hotpot is not something I would consider in a balmy 30 degrees celsius (86 Fahrenheit) day. \xa0However it is something my guests regardless the season prefer. We have been to this place many times in the past. Perhaps once/twice a year for the past 20 odd years.Food here is of premium quality not necessarily the healthiest. 9/10Service is also at a high level which is very rare for Chinese restaurants. 9/10Ambiance is getting a bit worn down but the patrons seem to enjoy the food here. Even at 9pm on a weeknight where the neighbourhood restaurants are hosting crickets, LHP is fully booked. 7/10 Price/value. This depends on how you look at it. Expensive yes. Is the price justified? As long as the demand is there, where folks are willing then the price is fair. This seems to be the case. 8/10 Definitely not a value eat. A semi fomo/status joint to be exact. Thankful not having to foot the bill.', 'Really authentic Cantonese hotpot!Came here with a friend from Guangzhou. We got the mushroom&chicken clay pot as our carbs. For the soup base, we got the pork bones. The soup itself was sooo rich and flavorful. Do give yourself a serving before putting anything down, and you will love it!The Japanese sliced beef was really fresh and tasty! We Enjoyed it more than the sliced lamb. The specialty, which is smashed fish with fried tofu skins was okay. The vegetables were good.The dessert, which was the red bean soup, was yummy and overly sweet. A great treat to finish!', 'A longstanding Vancouver restaurant, this is the perfect place to go on a cold winter night with family or friends. This place is loud, like Asian family gathering loud, so expect that type of ambiance. Did you know they also play happy birthday for you on their sound system too? It\'s great!Landmark is always one of the pricier places for hotpot in town but it\'s not pricy for its branding, extravagant decor or noodle dances. Rather - it\'s reasonably pricy for the quality of its food. Every plate is a piece of art. From the soup bases (I tried shark bone, wow) to the raw dishes, everything is phenomenally fresh. If you\'re willing to splurge, live seafood is an option. I like the ox tongue, fatty beef, scallop and pork jowl the most. Their fishballs are also extra chewy and ""bouncy"".Come early or make a reservation beforehand because wait times can be very long. I do like that they have shared long tables where two groups of people can dine with stoves on each end (or one big group).Servers are sometime forgetful, and don\'t expect much better than your typical cha chan tang (HK style joints), but they never have time to stand around and are always running around.', ""Thought the food was good but two of us had DIARRHEA after. Suspect something is off either the pork bone soup base or the deep fried black cod. The black cod is pretty expensive and fresh. Ordered cooking in two ways, hotpot and deep fried. The hotpot one was very tender I d recommend. The deep fried one was so oily so greasy. The oil didn't taste right too.. The waiter tried so hard to sell their fish head soup base (of cause that s the most expensive) and we said we don't eat fish head. And then I asked for any non MSG soup base recommendation, he still recommended the fish head soup and said the rest are all msg included ( well you know might be from some soup extract). In general maybe only the fresh seafood worth splurging"", 'Waygu beef will melt in your mouth! The soup base is so favourable. I usually drink 2 bowls before I even put any hot pot ingredients in. Very good quality, just a bit pricy but worth it.', 'This is a legit hot pot place in Vancouver.

We resorted to doing a lot of picture looking on Yelp! And looking and pointing to things other people had on their tables.We almost ordered a full fish because we asked for what kind of seafood and the server said he had one that was 1lb and it was thirtysome CA for it. Well...he came back with a fish over 3lbs..we quickly were able to cancel that request.As intimidating as it was, we were able to order what we wanted and it was one of the best hot pots I have had. They had quality meats and veggies and they give you a lot!For broth, we did the traditional pork and the schezuan and whoa was it spicy!

"[""Update: \xa0I was contacted by the manager shortly who was very helpful in informing me that due to staffing shortage during the pandemic, they are not able to make all the items and due to the short personal encounter he wasn't able to tell me that when I was there. \xa0I really appreciate for management to reach out to this bakery's fan who has been visiting for the past decade.***********Today/Sunday, we stopped by to buy some gingerbread man cookies before heading home to the US tomorrow. \xa0When I didn't see them I asked if they have any in the back and was told by 2 people that they don't have them until December. \xa0Then I told them, I was just here on Thursday (3 days ago) and bought 4 of them plus a snowman cookie. \xa0I was told, really?! we usually don't have them until December. \xa0I told them I've been here during late November for the past 10 years and I always by them for my kids because they're their favorite. \xa0Glad we bought some a few days ago, however it's a disappointment that the folks at the bakery don't know what they're telling their customers. \xa0I would've been fine if they said the cookies were sold out but talking about them like they never existed is bazaar.I'm now guessing this is under new management perhaps. \xa0In the future, we will call ahead to check and won't expect them to be there anymore so the kids are not disappointed again. \xa0We love Granville Island Public Market so we will still be back."", ""There are SO many desserts and pastries here that I never know which to get.

Key Lime Pie - I liked the tart filling of this pie, but the shell was a little dry! Chocolate Caramel Pecan Bar - my favorite part of this bar were the pecans in it! It is on the sweeter side, so I would pair it with a drink."", ""5 stars for the super awesome service recovery from the store manager Masa. He reached out to me after my review and offered to either refund me for the item I was charged but did not order in the first place or replace it with another item. I happened to be in Granville Island getting the Thai food (Sen Pad has legit Thai food!) and decided to drop by. Masa was apologetic about the new staff's inability to do the reverse charges then and was most kind in helping me choose what items to try. I asked for what would be good as I really did not want to get something which would be disappointing again. I thought it would just be one item to replace what I did not order but to my surprise, I was given 4 items to try. That was really unexpected but very much appreciated. That certainly delighted me in terms of the service. Sometimes excellent service can trump a negative experience. He totally recommends the cheesecake. Unfortunately I am the weird one who do not like cheesecake much. I do have quite an exacting palate especially for desserts. I am also very partial to the French style of patisserie which I think this place is not. So others may really enjoy the baked goods here. In the end, I decided to try the granola which is apparently popular with customers. Then Masa added the key lime tart, tiramisu and cinnamon record for me to try. I thought I would be paying for the tart and tiramisu but nope, they were on the house. I was told the cinnamon record was best to eat on the same day. It was freshly made that day. This time I could break it off easily and taste it better. It was really good! Flaky, buttery with a hint of saltiness. I can see why this is a crowd favorite. The key lime tart was decent. It had a slight tang which was not overpowering. As I had better key lime pie elsewhere (A Pie Hole), this did not wow me much. The tiramisu was also good. I was worried it would be on the dry side but no, the ladies fingers were soaked at the bottom. I would get this again. The granola was not bad. I liked the nuts but they were not very crunchy like other places. It was still ok though. Now I found something here which I could get in future -- tiramisu.

I wish the donuts had been a little warmer, but overall, a free dozen from Krispy Kreme is well worth it!!"", ""Can't be beat! \xa0 Melt in your mouth! \xa0 We came in cause my daughter had hurt herself so she was crying when we got there and the staff gave her a free kids donut. \xa0 So sweet. \xa0 \xa0Can't beat that you can watch them being made at certain times too. \xa0 \xa0Fun for all!""]",negative

"['Omg the food and service at the restaurant is amazing, best Lebanese food in Vancouver', ""One Friday night, we stumbled across Nuba after looking on Yelp for some delicious cuisines. Yelp did not let us down. We had no reservation, but the staff was accommodating and found us a seat. Great. The restaurant is small and cozy, sort of like something you'd find in the Mediterranean (I've never been to that area, but I figure it may resemble something from that area). Anyways, as we sat down, I decided to peruse through the menu. There were so many dishes to choose from, but we couldn't take our eyes off the 'the grand feast.' The pricing caught me off guard however. The menu read $36 for the feast (min 2 people). In my mind I thought this was too good to be true, a grand feast for $36 that says you need a minimum 2 people. I thought that meant the feast was so big that it required a minimum 2 people to finish.So we ordered and boy oh boy was it a feast. There were 3 lamb chops, hummus, potatoes, shrimp and many other things. I still thought 'wow all this for $36, this is too good to be true'. Well, you know what they say, when something is too good to be true, it probably is. As we finished the meal, we asked for the bill which came out to more than $100. My eyes bulged and my hands trembled and I thought, what happened to the $36. The waitress explained that it was $36 per person and a minimum of 2 is required to order it. Anyways, the meal was delicious and was worth every penny. The food was fresh and very clean. I felt like doing a workout right after. The atmosphere was also excellent. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to any one looking for a great meal. I'm giving it 4 stars because the location is decent but not great. We did not walk through gastown to get there, but instead the street that it's on from Canada place, which to me made me a bit uncomfortable.Overall it is definitely worth a visit."", ""Disappointed with the meals we ordered via delivery \xa0(on a Friday at 7 pm)! I have been to this specific location on multiple occasions and have LOVED it. But when ordering take out, we were so disappointed with the poetion sizes (which is not typical when dining in-house), especially the tabouli salad. I think between both meals, we maybe got 2 tbs worth if salad (looks big because its laying on too of the hummus and baba - but it was a sprinkle of salad - see picture).We ordered the La Feast (This Price is for 2: $49.50: Two course vegetarian mezze sampler including hummus, baba ghanooj, olives, pickles, feta, taboulleh, Najib's Special, falafel, mjadra, vegan stew & fattoush salad. Served with hot sauce, tahini sauce & tzatziki). We also never got tzatziki and the tabouleh serving was a joke. Fewer olives and just not what is typical.We also ordered the Le Grande Feast (This Price is for 2 Guests. $69.90: Two course sampler including hummus, baba ghanooj, tabouleh, olives, pickles, feta, fattoush salad, Najib's Special, roasted potatoes, lamb chops, spiced prawns & chicken skewers.). Again, not much taboulleh (which I assume they ran out of) and no tzatziki. We also only got one dip each of the hot sauce and tahini. Delivery is more expensive and less than what is expected at this price. Delivery is not worth it in my opinion (and is really disappointing). Food is always delicious but disappointed with being snubbed on a few dishes. We complained to the delivery app and no response."", ""I have several people recommending this place so I came with high expectations. But I was very underwhelmed.The best dish was red lentil soup but would recommend a little bit more lemon juice and salt with it.The pickled red cabbage that came with a lot of the dishes was excellent accompaniment to elevate the flavors. Our 1.5 yo loved it and had a whole bowl!!!Tabouleh was dry. Lamb hushwie was too gamey for our taste - may benefit from more onion sauteed with it. Perhaps my days spent in Paris where many Lebanese restaurants had to compete for business made my standards a bit too high so take my advice was a grain of salt.There was no coursing concept at this place. Whatever you order it will come out within minutes. Be prescriptive if you don't want all of your dishes come out at once."", ""With the great ratings, I was very excited to try Nuba in Gastown after a day downtown. It started out quite well as we had Najib's special as an appetizer to start off with. The cauliflower had great taste especially when mixed with the sauce. We got the bison flat iron steak as our main and while the bison was delicious, it felt odd to pair it with taro as it was a bit too chewy and bland. We liked dessert even less than our main which we ended up getting Znoud El-Sit. There was a bit too much ricotta cheese for my liking and the ricotta just masked the pistachio taste and looking back, I don't think we even got any mango...."", ""First time trying from the Nuba restaurants! Went to the Gaston location as it was closer to work, it is slightly tucked away as a below grade storefront, for reference: it is located right on the corner of the block across from Victory Square and Meat & Bread. I'd assume dine in would've been a great experience, the ambience of the interior decor is very cozy. Overall my takeout order was delicious! I enjoyed the option to go half and half on the rice/ potato option. The salad was well dressed, very tasty overall! Would definitely visit again."", ""Had the cauliflower Nabil's Special based on the waitress's recommendations, and it was great - not greasy, big portions, flavorful, and healthy at the same time. The Turkish coffee was also very enjoyable."", ""***visited summer 2019 This place is kinda hard/not obvious to find if you're not from Vancouver but oh is it worth the effort... (from what I remember you have to walk down stairs from the street sidewalk and it looks closed but it's not or something ... ) This was place was heavenly in every way. Probably the best Mediterranean food I have ever had. If you're in Vancouver, eat here one night - dim lighting and small tables so would be an AWESOME date spot or just a fun catch up with a friend like I did (:"", ""Spectacular food! \xa0One of the best babaganush duos I've ever had! \xa0We did the meat tasting menu and the only disappointing part was that we were leaving the next day and couldn't take our leftovers. \xa0Super nice service, great drinks!! \xa0We made reservations and very glad we did - it was packed."", ""I've walked by Nuba countless times when visiting Vancouver but never took the opportunity to dine. I'm so upset that it took me so long! I visited Nuba with my wife and friends. We ordered falafel lunch, Najib's special, lamb meatballs and and steak skewers. We left satisfied and extremely happy with all the flavours and great services. I was quite surprised by tasty jalapeño sauce, which offered a nice kick.""]",positive

It's definitely a bit steep in price but it was cool to experience and the kids enjoyed it."", 'I love ice cream like I love breathing.... okay maybe not that much, but you get the point. This is a fun place to come and get some good ice cream. Hundreds of flavor combinations you can literally make anything you want. A nice surprise finding this place after leaving Iron Age Korean BBQ for dinner. Enjoy!', ""The ice cream was terrible, the place is super dirty, and staff seemed high, but that isn't the reasoning for my 1 star. The issue is we watched the stoned cashier knock the entire stack of medium sized ice cream cups onto the floor, ask a customer to pick them up, place them back on the counter, and then serve ice cream in one of these floor-cups to a customer who came in just after they were retrieved from the ground."", ""This place is great to take your kids for the experience but don't expect cleanliness. When I arrived, there were four people ahead of me. During that time, none of the servers washed their hands even after handling money. The only reason the young lady who made my ice cream washed her hands was \xa0because she sneezed. I also gave them a three because you have to do trial and error to find the best ice cream taste. Mainly because they start the ice cream from cream ( no flavor) and you add your additional toppings. I chose to get the tres leche ice cream with caramel and pecans. It was delicious! However, I would prefer the servers wear gloves and wash their hands more often especially after handling cash."", ""Cool idea and interesting flavors. The line was quite slow and the metal bowls make for a very loud environment. It was exciting to see vegan on the board but it was so loud I couldn't really communicate with the person behind the calendar to understand if all of the flavors were inherently vegan or only select options. I got a lemon Italian ice which was quite good. I may try them again on a quieter day."", 'I think this location is run by a family. They work hard! Fun to see ice cream made. Fun to choose what goodies will be mixed in. You can also mix bases (I mixed Ube and pistachio). Prefer this place over Maggie moos and cold stone creamery. Tastes less artificial to me at sub zero. Great on a hot day after the aquarium. You should try this place!', ""Yum yum yum. What a cool experience to see the ice cream being made right before your eyes!! The anticipation as the smoke clouds from the liquid nitrogen rises and hides the view just enough for you begin imagining the final result and tasting the delicious flavors. I did a simple pistachio and my daughter did caramel with sprinkles mixed into it. I only wish the moment could have lasted longer as we enjoyed every single scoop!! I definitely recommend this place for all ages and for all picky eaters. \xa0You literally pick every ingredient that goes into your masterpiece so there is definitely something for everyone. If I had to add anything, I'd ask for them to get some real pistachios so I could have added them to my pistachio ice cream."", 'This was our first time trying this. We tried the Tropical turbine and the strawberry sigma combinations. The strawberry sigma was very delicious and sweet with a strong strawberry flavor. But if you do not enjoy sour ice cream do not try the tropical turbine. Waffle cones were very delicious and prices were cheap.', ""This place was good! The workers didn't seem to speak good English but we made it through. I ordered the root beer flavor.

We split one (we had more food adventures ahead of us so portion control) but damn we both could have easily finished one each!! The cornbread waffle was amazing and the maple bacon was next level! Perfectly cooked!! The maple syrup and bacon brought enough sweetness to the meal without being overpowering. Having a cornbread waffle helped keep the sweetness down and made for an enjoyable and balanced meal!Chicken could have been crispier, it was kind of soft which was sad, but the chicken was juicy and well cooked!!

Apple, Bacon Bits, Brie, Balsamic reduction and Avocado. Should this be called ABBBBA?The combination might sound odd but it was sooo good! Waffles freshly made and crispy. Balanced nicely with the creamy avocado+melted brie. Sweet Apple slices and poured the maple syrup on top felt Scandilicious.... yes, I just went there. The chicken and waffles were also excellent.

The drink as my hubby would describe it looks like a unicorn rainbows. Pretty cute. Food and drink were both yummy! Nice they do delivery too which is nice.

As we were cutting up the giant slabs of fried chicken, there was a pleasant surprise of some crispy slices of Maple Glazed Bacon underneath - forgot that was in the ingredients. The Fried Chicken was a pretty dry but the crispy crust was not oily and the syrup helped to add some moisture. It was paired nicely with the Cornbread waffle, which was semi-sweet and held up nicely with a good chew. It was a pretty decent amount for $16.We shared the Leaf Erikson and it was a great lighter savoury waffle to balance out the heavier chicken and waffles. The melted cheddar cheese, spinach, hummus, pickled artichokes and savoury waffle were a very flavourful and healthy option. Lastly, we shared a Tex-Mex soup. A hearty semi-spicy soup with plenty of beans, onions, and carrots. Overall, a nice cozy, rustic vibe to enjoy some delicious savoury and sweet waffles. But it's not just waffles, they have breakfast and lunch/dinner meals like sandwiches and burgers.

Although a little pricey if you're on a budget, it was great overall experience with excellent service."", ""I can't wait to go back. My food was so good and the bottomless mimosas almost anywhere is what really makes the experience for me. Thank God the food was delicious. I sat on the patio. I recommend making reservations before the weekend. We ordered: the Artisan Steak Sandwich with breakfast potatoes Pinch Me (Flank Steak Skewers, eggs, potatoes in a bowl) The Devil (crispy deviled eggs) and bottomless \xa0Mimosas The food is good and the service was friendly"", ""My friends and I stopped in the Menagerie for happy hour on a Saturday afternoon. We arrived about 15 minutes before happy hour started and our waitress was cool with us drinking our water lol. And she came back promptly at 4 PM to take our orders. They offered several drink and food specials for happy hour. We shared the blackberry wings which were amazing! We also loved the curry fried cauliflower. I would recommend this dish! We enjoyed our drinks while we sat out on their nice patio which sits on a busy street corner. We were entertained by some young drunk folks lol! \xa0But my favorite dish was dessert. We ordered the donut bread pudding which did not have raisins (yay, because they are disgusting). When I tell you that each bite of this bread pudding, topped with cinnamon rolled ice cream, took me to another planet I am not lying! If you miss out on this desert you are missing out on life! And honestly I'm glad I do not live near this restaurant as I would be eating this desert several times a week. Bottom line you must try it!I enjoyed the atmosphere and our server was delightful. My friends and I will definitely be back to try some other menu items (and order another bread pudding)!"", 'Wow. The food is absolutely fantastic. We went here during Magical Dining as a group of 4. Since each course gives you 3 options to choose from, we ordered either 1 or 2 of everything from the entire menu and shared all dishes.Honestly, I don\'t know how people are able to finish 3 courses on their own. Each plate is easily sharing size, and with us sharing 4 plates for each course, we were completely stuffed! The rundown:Appetizer - The mussels in chorizo beer broth and nicoise toast were delicious. Both very freshy and tasty. But the filet mignon tips were the clear winner. Super tender and flavorful.Main - OMG, that lobster and crab udon. Simply indulgent. Creamy and rich with plenty of crab and lobster, I would go back just for this. The filet though was a clear favorite amongst the majority of the table. Seasoned and cooked perfectly, it practically melted in the mouth. The salmon was unfortunately overshadowed by the other two dishes, but it had great flavors and just a hint of spiciness that everyone enjoyed.Dessert - We barely had any room left for dessert after that epic feast, but we managed. The donut churros were the table favorite, but I particularly enjoyed the mousse, which was chocolatey but not too sweet. The poor poppy seed cake didn\'t get enough attention, but it was good in its own right, especially if you are looking for a ""healthier"" dessert.Happy to say that COVID measures are in place, all the staff wear masks and tables are spaced appropriately.One minor quibble - When we arrived for our reservation, the hostesses kept insisting that the res was for the outdoor patio, even though I knew I had booked it for the dining room inside (and away from the hot and humid weather outside). I showed them the res on my phone to prove it so. Honest mistake, no biggie.However, after I showed them the res, the hostesses told me that if I rrrrreeeally wanted to sit inside, they would bump someone else\'s res to make it happen. Seriously? A tip: please don\'t make your customers feel bad for your mistakes. I shouldn\'t be put in the position of being the bad guy here.Quibble aside, everything else including the servers were amazing and we will definitely return.', ""Wow the food was delicious! I had never had any gravy base chorizo style so it was quite interesting to try that! I would totally prefer chorizo gravy any day over than the traditional gravy! The deviled eggs were a real winner as well because they fried the outer parts of the eggs. Overall food was great not pictured: my lobster scramble. The reason I'm giving it three stars was the service wasn't that great nor was getting checked up on... we waited quite sometime just to get a fill on our drinks or when we asked for water. It also didn't seem as busy but that was the only downfall of it.""]",positive
"['I have been coming here for the last few years to pick blueberries multiples times throughout the season! They have so many varieties of blueberries, all which are delicious! This year it looked like some of the early season ones got wiped out by the cold? The fields are closed off :( However they still have a few varieties - emeralds which are an all time fave! Super big berries, some the size of a quarter! Not too tart and right amount of sweetness for $4 lb. Get a stamp card and you get a free pound after 10lbs. They have some of their own food trucks- must get the frozen blueberry lemonade and blueberry donuts!!Their gift shop has some cute stuff- I recommend the honey.Sunflower field is gorgeous and great for influences, you now have to pay to enter the area but you do get a free sunflower with admission.Large strawberry you pick- lots lots lots of berries! Peaches you pick- never tried them, but it looks like a big hit.They have different activities throughout the year, a great place for families. Clean restrooms. Wonderful family farm!', ""I have loved Southern Hill Farms for years, and it just keeps getting better and better! The sunflower and strawberry fields were in full bloom, the prices are being kept the same, and there are free shuttle rides via tractor to and from end fields - which is an awesome addition! There were multiple food trucks options for visitors, and all of it was very reasonable/delicious. While the seasonal strawberry donuts don't compare to the apple cider ones (personal opinion), the blueberry deserts and handcrafted lemonade is fantastic! Even though it's only $2.50 per glass, our group easily spent $20 on refills and the frozen slush version. We had the chance to listen to some live music, and I hope they come back to play often!! Overall, definitely come check this place out at least once a season. All of their events are on their site and socials!"", ""I don't know how anyone could give this place a low review. We showed up an hour before closing to pick strawberries (and possibly sunflowers) and from the moment we parked the staff was incredibly sweet and friendly. They directed us which way to go and explained all of their current sales (the nice gentleman even remembered us and gave us a very nice farewell as we left)The strawberries here are out of this world. They sell at $4 a lb so not far off from grocery store prices but these look so much better. You can pick until your hearts content which is what ended up with us spending $26 on strawberries LOL! They also had beautiful HUGE green onions for only $1 We also stopped by on our way out and grabbed a blueberry cobbler and two blueberry lemonades. The drinks were perfectly balanced between blueberry flavor and a tart fresh lemon aftertaste and the cobbler was to die for! Perfectly warm with a buttery base and the ideal mix of tart and sweet to make you feel like you're eating a bowl of love. I can't wait to come back!"", ""This is such a great family spot! The fields are beautiful and there's strawberry donuts right now which were delicious !! Not what I expected (was thinking of some sort of strawberry jam type donut) but we all loved it. I also love how there's fires and corn hole and lots of seating to relax and enjoy the sun. We went on a perfect chilly Sunday and I would definitely return for another family outing! My only complaint is I wish the sunflowers were available to just take pictures and walk through without paying $6. I didn't wanna pick any, just have a peak! But no worries it was still a very fun visit :)"", ""I don't know how I took so long to visit Southern Hill Farms. Well worth the drive... even on a cold, wet day. Southern Hill Farms is home to all different types of produce and flowers you can pick seasonally. They have so many aspects to enjoy. It's free to enter the facility and enjoy most of those features. Parking is also free. This includes fire pits (excellent on a cold/windy day like the day we came, a covered area with various food vendors including dessert: donuts, coffee, frozen lemonade and another vendor with hot food: such as hot dogs, French fries and even adult beverages. There are also food trucks that occasionally run with other options. Even on a freezing day they had live music as well. We walked up right during a performance of Strawberry Fields. Talk about Serendipity. For the kids along with picking fruit and flowers they have a free park for kids. For additional cost they have a children fun zone. Prices vary based on child's height. The fun zone includes actual rides.. like a carousel, bouncing pad and more. Unfortunately for us it was closed the day we came due to inclement weather but it looked very fun. During our visit they had sunflowers and strawberries in season. They rent wagons for $8 which come super in handy while picking fruit and toting around a toddler. It's free to pick strawberries but it does cost money $4/Ib which is very fair for how amazing their strawberries taste. The employee working the strawberry stand giving out the trays for picking explained to us the two different flavors they offered which were both scrumptious. We had a blast picking them ourselves and went home with a pretty hefty load. Sunflowers were also in season. We were poofed from picking Strawberries so we decided to just take a few cute photos in front of the flower field and purchase some pre-cut sunflowers instead. Just as beautiful and they package it up for you. They have lots of cute photo spots with rustic trucks. We cannot wait to come back during peach, zinnias, blueberries and pumpkin season. I am thrilled to make more family memories with delicious fruit!!!"", 'Great way to spend the day with family, alone, or a romantic day! This Farm has a free entrance (unless you go to the sunflower field which is $6And each person gets one sunflower) and is cashless venue (only cards/ apple pay), so yay for safe options! \xa0They have foodtrucks, seasonal items to eat and a shop. They also have machines and game for the little ones, so be ready to spend a good 2 hours! My fave thing to eat was the grilled cheese with gouda cheese and blueberry jam and the mimosa! The venue is huge,So even though is always packed you will have PLENTY of space to roam around.', ""Would definitely be returning when it's less cold outside! Even with it being cold today, we all had a wonderful time, they did have a lot of accommodations for the cold weather such as a few fire pit areas that were free to seat around (they did offer s'more's making kits for an additional price) the food trucks offered hot chocolate, hot coffee. They did have strawberry donuts \xa0which were amazing just wish they were warm! I paid $6 for a 1/2 dozen, so a 1$ each.We paid $12.49 for a box tray. I wanna say it was $4 a pound. They had quite a few fields of strawberries to choose from.They had live music and a playground area, corn hole games, A large connect to four-game, a lot of covered patio area, and rides! The staff was friendly and helpful! Overall I would recommend it to anyone, our family will be back soon!"", 'Definitely worth driving from orlando to clermont kn a sunday funday with the fam. Strawberry and blueberry picking was so much fun that even us parents enjoyed it. Fun activity to do with your kids. \xa0No entrance fee. Just pay for by the pounds. What really made it awesome was the various foodtruck and kids activities to do here. They had giant slides, carousel, \xa0bungee jumping, smores pit, swings, etc etc.', ""Went today for the second year, to get some donuts, lemonade and sunflowers!! I have to say, most of all of the employees were wonderful and sooooo friendly. I love that about this place, except the girls at the petting zoo, they didn't even bother to say hello. They looked annoyed and bored. I noticed a few things about it this year. The price was double because they added a corn maze and some jumpers as well as rides for kids. While it is wonderful for the kids, what happens to the families that have newborns or no kids? Then, they all have to pay for the new additions that they are not enjoying? Would be better to just have parents buy tickets instead, but no, everyone needs to pay for the increase. That seemed greedy to me. I also noticed that the blueberry lemonade didn't have any blueberries for garnish, that would be a great touch to the lemonade! This is the last weekend and they ran out of tumblers and pumpkin beer. Also, the donuts are not as fresh tasting as they are on the weekend. I think maybe it could be because they are at the bakery rather than the normal place, they probably fry it and then send it over to the bakery. Tarah was very nice though. The tractor driver today was AMAZING. He had a wonderful personality and great jokes! I think he works at Disney, very fitting. He stopped the tractor to tell us a little more about the blueberries and picking season. He made our day. The restrooms are pretty clean, I just wish that there were paper towels in there rather than just air dryers. It is also air-conditioned in there, so that definitely helps with the warm temperatures. They did not have any of the fire pits going today, maybe they just light them when someone purchases the s'more packages. I am not sure if it is because it was a weekday, but it is unfortunate that the weekday tickets do not get the same things as the weekend tickets. Prices are the same as well. There were only two food trucks today, and then the little service window inside with burgers. Not many food options and if you are a vegetarian, you have slim pickings.  If amenities will be cut during the week, then prices should be a little less for tickets. I'll put that in their suggestion box lol The two ladies at the sunflower area distributing scissors were very kind as well. There were a couple of employees riding little utv's were driving very fast and didn't slow down. They need to be more careful. Overall, I give 3 stars for \xa0this year and that was for the majority of the wonderful staff and how they care for the farm. Will still be back next year but"", ""By far one of the best places in Lake county where you can enjoy with the entire family! There are a variety of food trucks for you to chose from. My favorite is the Southern Hill Bakery! Their frozen blueberry lemonade is delicious! This past weekend my girlfriend's and I decided to visit and have an early Galentine's Day outing. Many of them had never been. They all feel in love and let me know that they'll be back with their families. If you're ever looking for something different and fun this is the perfect place.The staff is very accommodating and friendly I was lucky to meet Samantha who recommended the best spot for us to enjoy the farm, and Chris who made all of feel welcome! You can thank me later!""]",positive
"['Ever since New Fortune closed, this has become my ""go to"" place for Dim Sum in Austin. \xa0They have all the expected items, and since Covid you order off the menu with your phone. \xa0We were unsuccessful using the promoted coupon (2 for 1 mimosas), and the waitress was not helpful. \xa0Nonetheless, I\'d still say it\'s currently the best place in Austin for Dim Sum at a somewhat reasonable price (vs a couple of downtown spots that are $$$). \xa0Just remember you\'re in Austin, so it\'s not going to rank with Dim Sum places in the East and West coast big cities. \xa0It\'s definitely what you would expect, but nothing was especially remarkable. \xa0I was also disappointed there was no mayo sauce with the shrimp ball or crab claw (which is usually standard at most places). \xa0Again, the waitress was not helpful, as she just said they didn\'t have it and didn\'t bother suggesting a possible alternative. \xa0I\'d do 3.5 stars if I could.', ""2:15 on a Thursday, there were two parties of two finishing up when we arrived. After that the restaurant was empty except for us. First time having dim sum here, so ordered several classics to get a sense of the place. Har gow, pork shumai, xiao long bao (soup dumpling), chicken feet, baked egg custard. They didn't have the egg custard and offered us steamed custard bao instead. The food was just OK. Nothing terrible, nothing amazing. Didn't look or taste completely fresh. The xiao long bao was nicely soupy, but the meatball inside tasted odd with a weird herb/seasoning I don't usually taste. Chicken feet portion was extremely small. Bao dough to custard ratio was too high. As many other reviewers have noted, the prices seem high for what you get, but I understand that's just part of the new post-Covid reality. Our server/host was very nice and efficient. Three big minuses: the noise, the restroom smell, and the included gratuity. Noise: The kitchen is very loud with lots of shouting, and they keep the doors open directly to the dining room. It didn't take help that we were seated directly in front of those doors (in an almost empty restaurant). Also, the server/host's cell phone at the front desk was on and loudly ringing / text message alerting regularly throughout our meal. Restrooms: Just stinky. The whole restroom area really. Gratuity: They automatically added 15% gratuity to the check for a party of two. We would have tipped at least that much anyway, but I think that's tacky. So total was $43 for two people to eat a very small, underwhelming meal. We both left still hungry. Won't be returning."", 'It is a convenient place across the tesla supercharger so I gave it a try.

The Dim Sum is pretty solid and about what I'd expect. It's served at all times as well which is a huge plus! All of the dishes came out fairly quickly and were packed and wrapped well- from the Shumai to the Lotus leaf with sticky rice. My only complaint is the portion size, I wish there was more for what you were paying.

Moving on to food..., we ordered 6 different items that we were familiar with to do the comparison. \xa0We ordered the steamed bbq pork bun, pork rib with black bean sauce, shrimp har gow, sticky rice with chicken, shrimp shumai and pork shumai, and bbq pork rice noodle roll. \xa0I wouldn\'t say I was blown away, but it was ok. \xa0I left with a few leftover, but was not fulfilled as I would at my ""go to"" place. \xa0I also wanted to add that their prices are at least $2-3 more than the average dim sum restaurants. \xa0We\'re always ISO tasty dim sum around town.So if your in the area, and not much of a critic as I am, I\'m sure you may enjoy it, just be ready to pay that 15% service charge and your tip. \xa0This put a sour spot in my experience.', ""Amazing, delicious, and worth it!!! This is a dim sum spot I'll be visiting again. Good food, made fresh, AND did I mention good? Chicken feet were on point (don't knock it til you try it) and the Shumai was my second favorite.

"['3.5/4 stars for me. Inside ambience was clean & airy! And staff was very friendly. Caramel macchiato was very yummy, creamy, good foam albeit a bit on the weaker side. My croissant egg sandwich was delicious but half my croissant was pretty charred. Would go back !', ""Came here and was looking for some coffee. Asked the cashier if there was coffee in the mocha. She couldn't hear me, so I repeated my question. Then she literally repeated my question and she still didn't understand my question. Then my friend saw the menu again (it moves on the TV screen) and it listed espresso under mocha. So he said out loud that there was espresso, then she was able to understand the question. I would think that's a pretty simple question if you're working at a coffee shop. I ended up getting the mocha for $7.50 for a large. $7.50 for decent mocha, nothing special about it.

"[""This is my favorite cafe in Orlando by far. Their coffee is delicious and always has a new specialty-type latte to try.

If you're feeling a little adventurous you can also try a cocktail or coffee cocktail while you're there as well. They really have it all. The atmosphere is laid back with outlets near most seats so it's a perfect work-from-cafe spot which is what I usually love to hop over there for.

They also have a disco room for when the DJ comes on weekends. I hear they have salsa lessons on Tuesday evenings which I'll be attending next!

The decor of this venue is absolutely beautiful. You can tell this venue was made with class and carefully designed and a gem. The breakfast I had this morning blew me away as well. The potion size was excellent and filled me to the max. My partner thought the same as well. My wrap was packed with chicken,potato's and eggs along with sauce that I couldn't quite taste but if it was in here it was still good. My partner had the lox toast and that was delicious and as well it was very portion sized as well. I'm unsure of the other times on the menu. I had hot chocolate, it was decent and the mimosas was basic also. Much more juice than champagne, so in the future I'd rather just stick with the wrap that was suggested to me. Otherwise, I would come back!"", ""Ooohh my!!! What a experience.. can I just say I've never been so entertained.

We also always bring family and friends there and often get the jars of golden tumeric broth. Unfortunately I will not be visiting again. Mid-October I had a flare up of GI-related health issues, and after not eating for a couple days and spending the time in bed, the only thing I was feeling like eating was Chau (the best medicine!). So I ordered via telephone, and drove to the Victoria location to pick it up. I approached the counter and stated I was here to pick up take out, to which the lady responded ""ok, vaccine card and ID please"" and I again stated, ""Oh no, I\'m just wanting to get my take out soup"" and she stated ""You don\'t have your vaccine passport and ID????"" (No I did not have it on me, this is not a requirement to pick up takeout). Then she quickly, in a panicked voice, stated several times ""go outside! go outside! go wait outside!!!"" So I hurried outside to stand in the pouring rain when I\'m already feeling unwell. I was in shock the way she was treating me and considered leaving, but having worked in hospitality/service industry for 12 years I did not want my unpaid for food to go to waste. A few minutes later a gentleman came out with my take out and handed me the debit machine to pay. I asked him why I was asked for ID and vaccine passport while trying to pick up take out and he responded ""it\'s the provincial health order.\' I\'ve been a nurse for the last 5 years, and believe me, that was not the provincial health order. I told him that\'s not in the order, and once again he responded it was the PHO. I have picked up takeout from 10+ restaurants since then, and it has never been an issue. That experience has left such a sour taste in my mouth for my once-favorite-restaurant that I would never return to be treated like that.', 'All the food I have tried from here is absolutely delicious. My boss recommended this place to me and my neighbour gave me a gift card as a thank you for a favour. The first time we ordered there were four of us (me being the only vegan) with pretty different tastes in food. We all LOVED our food. I have ordered a few times since then and can never remember what I got the previous time so I seem to always end up with something new to try. Everything so far is delicious.', 'Still the best. Even ordering to go it is stellar.

Their items are usually always great, however, I am very disappointed with their execution this time. Included is a photo of the coconut shake which I requested for it to be no ice because it was a very cold night. This is unacceptable behaviour from a restaurant. I know of no other place that under-fills their drinks like this due to a no ice request. If this is the case, I think they should list the amount of ml on their menu to let the customers know the exact amount they are purchasing. Or at least inform the customer at point-of-purchase. I am actually already very surprised that I found one piece of coconut meat in this takeout drink because I've received this drink multiple times without a single piece of coconut meat when I get it to go (they usually put two pieces when you order for dine in). For a drink that is charged at $6.25 plus taxes, I am very disappointed in the amount that was given. It is barely half full.Overall, the taste of food and drinks is great but I am very disappointed in the restaurant's execution and inconsistency."", ""How are you doing today I hope you have fun today I hope you are feeling up to drive safe and healthy and good luck with your family and family \xa0love the Little puppy's"", ""This was our second visit, and it was as great as the first.

I definitely recommend this place to any vegans or vegetarians out there, but meat eaters shouldn't pass it up if they're looking for something different."", 'I\'ve tried coming to this restaurant twice and both times it was packed. I finally got to try this restaurant today and was excited to see what the hype was about. Honestly, it wasn\'t really anything special or spectacular. You order at the front and find a seat and food is served to you. The servers were great. The ladies were so friendly and came by to collect our dishes (even though it\'s half self served) and asked if everything was okay. We didn\'t find the gentleman at the cashier (the owner?) very friendly. No smile or friendly conversation or ""thank yous"" when we went up to order. Prices are around $11-14 and portion is decent. BUT I wasn\'t full when we left. I ordered the Rickety Rickshaw and it is like a normal Vietnamese vermicelli bowl, but without meat. It had carrots, cucumber, radish, bean sprouts, bean curd, and four spring roll bites. While the ingredients were fresh, I found the dish very ordinary. The spring rolls were hard (like slightly stale) and I found the proportion was a little off. I was done the spring rolls and was left with a lot of noodles and veggies.My bf ordered the Tropical Rainstorm and the coconut was overwhelming. If you like coconut then you would like this dish! My bf didn\'t like it because it was on the sweet side and tasted kind of like dessert. We also tried the thai milk tea and coconut pandan icecreams. We liked how the icecreams weren\'t very sweet, but the flavour was light. The coconut pandan icecream was quite delightful, but I couldn\'t taste the Thai milk tea flavour for the Thai milk tea icecream. Would we come back? Probably not. If we were craving vegan or vegetarian dishes, we prefer the \xa0MeeT restaurants because their dishes are flavour bombs!', 'The golden temple soup has healing powers.

"[""We went to visit Tuc for dine out 2020, to try their dinner menu. I started with a pear iced tea, which was pretty good although the pear purée or syrup settled to the bottom and made it so the drink got sweeter the more you drank. We ordered the salted courgettes with cheese, and upgrade to the pork belly crackling. Seriously, best upgrade I've ever paid for. The crackling was charred on the outside and so fatty and flavourful on the inside . The reduction went with it so nicely, and you get a surprising portion. (I actually had to take some of my main home because it was so much). Next up came Togarashi Ahi Tuna and Ayano's chicken Karaage. Both dishes were fantastic, with the richness of the deep fried meat and fish balanced out by noodles and greens. The dessert was a lemon English pudding, which turned out to be a denser lemon cake in a jar with whipped cream and strawberries."", 'It was actually in July, 2018.Very nice place, found it after a walk into the city. Nice cocktail and nice food too.', ""On our trip to Vancouver we wanted to try this place out for dinner one night. Luckily they are open late on the weekends as our drive up from Seattle got us in a bit tardy for the usual dinner hour. The inside has a rustic look with wood paneling, rope and iron lanterns, and minimalist decorations. The low lightning gave off a nice intimate atmosphere for a late dinner. Our server was very friendly and helpful in ordering gluten free for me. There are limited items on the menu that can accommodate a gf diet, so better not be picky! We waited a pretty long time for food but were happy that our server did a good job keeping our drinks refreshed while we waited. We started with the ploughman's board which had some various cheeses, cured meats and other accoutrements. Overall it was pretty tasty, but everything was very salty, would have loved some fruit on there to change up the flavor profile a bit. The husband enjoyed his cup of french onion soup which had a nice crispy top. He also enjoyed the mac n cheese. I had the chicken kabob (only gf entree item) but was not really impressed by it or the accompanying salad. Overall it seemed like a pretty solid place and a great spot to hang out late if in the area. The husband enjoyed his meal a bit more than i did, but as a whole it seemed like a solid place."", ""One of the best places in town for Chicken and Waffles. Large portion of crispy chicken, yet not dry or burnt like some other places. The waffles could be crispier as it's almost cake-like in density but that does help it absorb the sweet syrup that comes with the dish. They only serve this on their brunch menu though, available Friday - Sunday. They are not opened for lunch the rest of the days.Also, be aware they charge $1 for hot water with lemon."", 'Was in town for the day, I done heard some good things about this spot so we decided to come here for a late brunch/mid afternoon lunch. This place wasn\'t too far from where I was staying, so we took a walk down to the Gastown area off W. Cordova St. Nice looking spot, cool decor, welcoming and friendly greetings as we entered. We were pretty darn hungry! Brunch menu was the only option, not too big of a menu, some of their appetizers/starters looked good so we tried a few and got the ""Pork Belly Cracklin"" and the ""Crispy Bacon & Egg"". The pork belly was pretty darn good, meaty, a little fatty, crisp, and on the well done side. Get it! \xa0The crispy bacon & egg is just like it sounds served in a round-ish form. That was pretty good too.As for our mains, theses were the only entree selections on the menu that sounded good, trust me, you will feel the same. ""Tuc Loco Moco"" was just ok to me, it\'s their version of this classic home style dish, not the mom & pop style you be thinking. It has the meat burger patty, swiss cheese, sunny side up egg over dirty rice and brown gravy. \xa0It\'s served in a cast iron skillet. As mentioned, it was just ok to me, the gravy was pretty runny, so the skillet was a bit watery where the rice was sorta swimming in it. Pretty basic in flavor, nothing too exciting in my book. We were hungry so we still ate it up and hate wasting food. We also got their popular "" Crispy Chicken & Waffles"", it is pretty darn popular, pretty much every table ordered this. We actually liked this a lot and can see why everyone is getting this. Not chicken on the bone, it\'s breaded chicken breast strips and a couple of savory waffles served with maple syrup. You get like 4 pretty good sized chicken strips, the batter was good, not super thick or bread-y, not dry for being breasts, the waffle was good too. When sharing this, you are counting in your mind who would get the last bite....you know what I mean. Get this!Service was great, our server was super friendly, quick and johnny on the spot when we needed stuff, no need to write down your order, she will remember it to the T and will check on you and remove any unnecessary items off your table to give you more room, she was good!

The bacon & egg and elk carpaccio were the best. The pork crackling was a little over done but it is probably even better when it's not. The lamb in a hole was great. Perfect dish for a chilly day. The hangar steak was ok but nothing special. It was nice and lean though. The desserts were good, pretty hefty though. Sharing one amongst 2 ppl is probably sufficient unless you have a serious sweet tooth. My cocktail was pretty good as well. Overall, timing could be improved. My drink didn't come until 3 dishes in. I wanted a cocktail, then a glass of red with my lamb in the hole but the cocktail came so late I couldn't order wine. The appetizers came immediately and then there was a 15 min or so gap till the mains. Then another long gap till dessert. A place with strong appetizers like this one could space out the appetizers so we could enjoy them one by one rather than crowded the table with all of them at once. Also, very nice that the music is not deafening. Could actually have a conversation here. Overall, heavier dishes. Go hungry. Not a place to go to when you want something light and healthy."", ""I'm so glad that we chose to dine at Tuc Craft Kitchen for our one night in Vancouver!

Tempura White Fish ($9.00) - This appetizer came with the tastiest sauce ever! Fish was super fresh and light. Taste: 5/52. Beef Al Forno ($25.00) This dish is small, but pretty heavy and filling. It's braised beef, mashed potatoes, mushrooms, goat cheese, and chocolate gravy. Taste: 4.5/53. Blackened Hanger Steak ($27.00). This was our favorite dish. It's seared hanger steak, coconut cream, squash purée and garlic confit fingerlings. Taste: 5/5. MUST ORDER. 4. Chocolate Ginger Budino \xa0($9.00). Wish there was a little more texture in this desert, but it still tasted amazing. It's ginger custard, salted caramel, and a chocolate cigar. Taste: 4.5/5.

We were curious yet standoff ish about the black pudding, and our server was nice enough to give a sample on the house for us to try.

Tuc Craft Kitchen is a small establishment and if you are not paying attention, you will miss it. As soon as we entered, we were greeted by the amazing staff and we were seated right away and brought two cups of water to our table. My husband ordered the Waffles & Pig and I ordered the Tuc Mex. The portion of both dishes was very generous. \xa0The waffle & pig is a take of the traditional waffles & fried chicken dish, but it's served with pulled pork instead. The pork was very tender and flavorful. The poached eggs were cooked to perfection. The bright orange yolk of the egg was oozing out as you lightly poked the egg. My dish also came with poached eggs. It was served in a very cute cast iron skillet. The black beans with pieces of lamb....it was delicious. The presentation of both dishes was on point.

It\'s an incredible meal and atmosphere every single time, without fail. We have friends who come into town regularly and say ""can we go to that Turkish place?"" The answer is always yes.

Trust me, you\'ll be back!', 'The restaurant atmosphere and service is lovely and the food tasted wonderful. However, the portions are insane and disproportionate (was given enough rice for six people) and the price is absolutely not worth it. $5 bread with no flavor and dip, $20+ chicken with probably about $2 worth of rice and vegetables (but nothing green???). While I enjoyed my meal, each bite was slightly tainted by the feeling of being jipped. I suppose if you eat a lot of food this would be a good option for you, but if you prefer smaller portions definitely choose somewhere else!', ""I really wish there was a Bosphorous in Tampa, it's that good. This particular night, friends and I were heading home from MCO airport and thankfully I was in charge of finding a place to eat. Of course i chose this place lol. You must get the following food: lavash bread with babaganoush and sautéed eggplant dip. Disclaimer: get the full size, don't bother getting a sampler like we did. For entree, my friend has beyti kabab which looked heavenly, he loved it and i had lamb shank. Aside from the lack of spice in the lamb, it was great entree. Might i add, BIG PORTION.

The restaurant has good ambiance for a party or date night, and the staff is very attentive and nice. Just remember to make a reservation for busier nights during rush hours.Their signature lavas (baked bread similar to Naan) and mixed appetizer is good for a big party. While the top part of the lavas bread is light, thin, and fluffy, I found the bottom of the lavas to be too doughey (almost 2.5-3x the thickness of the top layer). My go to appetizer is always braised lamb shanks which is tender and full of flavor from the seasoning. However, it doesn't come with much vegetables, or any pickled sides to cut through the richness. So a protip is to ask for a side of their pickled cabbage and carrots to help balance the dish out. I also tried their kebap but can be hit or missed at times due to being a overcooked and dry.TLDR; great ambiance & friendly staff. Kebap can be hit or miss depending on how well it was cooked that day. Stick w/ lamb shank and ask for a side of pickled cabbage and carrots to help balance out the dish."", 'Very disappointing for me to write this, but last night\'s experience was bad.

So, we opted to just have an open invite to a few friends to meet for happy hour and appetizers. Last night, 9 of us trickled in - which was fine, as we had sat way in the back on their 2 bar high tops. Here\'s where it started to go wrong. When #8 showed up, we were missing a bar stool, so an AVAILABLE one was grabbed from the bar (counter area), to accommodate our latest CONSUMING guest. The manager immediately came over, and what we thought to be a gesture to accommodate us, was presented more in an unwelcoming tone. He said, ""yeah, we will need to set tables together here instead, so you have more room"". We expressed we were fine, and he quickly snapped to say, ""just can\'t have you taking stools from the bar!"" What? We were not just taking stools from the bar! We were consuming as a group at tables that have always been an extension of the bar! The condescending tone he said it in, was stern enough to set the downhill tone for the rest of the night. Anyway - we gave in, he started pushing tables towards us, then said, ""get up, just grab your drinks, and you\'ll sit here"". So here we were, with drinks in our hands while he\'s pulling tables from their private room and making a commotion, dragging tables, chairs, and now pushing bar stools to the wall. Why not just accommodate us in the private room?So, to add insult to injury, he comes back to say, ""oh and all will be paid in one check!"" \xa0What??? So, everyone at the bar is forced to pay together? He further adds, ""it\'s policy on our menu"". We tell him, that\'s not possible, as we have always paid separately (obviously been to happy hour many times before) and he walks away, while we are left puzzled trying to figure out one of two things. Do we just turn to our accountant to play cashier on our behalf, or do we just walk out? Naturally, we stayed. We\'re professionals - and we had placed our kitchen orders. Not cool!He obviously heard us talking about the inconvenience, to only come back to yell out, ""best I can do is 3 checks max!""I took my time to write this as I feel it\'s important you know that every effort was made to make us feel as though we were a disturbance.

I was all for it, not a lot of places I would trust to have seafood in landlocked Ohio... and I love shrimp!So why is it called. Bubba Gump... its all due to two film characters in the movie Forrest Gump: Benjamin Buford ""Bubba"" Blue and Forrest Gump. In the film, Bubba suggested getting in the shrimping business and, ultimately, Forrest pursued the idea after Bubba\'s death in the Vietnam War.Bubba Blue has this great quote about Shrimp in the movie: ""Anyway, like I was sayin\', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. Dey\'s uh, shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There\'s pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. That- that\'s about it."" Amen my fellow shrimp lover!Anyway we arrived at Bubba Gump and got on the wait list. We were told it would be 30 minutes, so we went to the bar area to get some drinks. The bar tender... sucked. Beers he could get... the mixed drinks not so much. I ordered a Sombrero. He didn\'t know what that was, i told him what it was... and he still messed it up. Tasted all wrong... not sure if the Kahlua was bad. My coworker friend Tobi also got another drink and she didn\'t like it either. Not an auspicious start to the night thats for sure. Our tables soon were ready and when i got to the table i quickly ordered a beer. I ultimately choose to have the $20 for 22... which is a mix of southern friend shrimp, tempura shrimp with fries and cole slaw. The shrimp was delicious! Omg! I missed eating shrimp so much... only my second time at a restaurant all year. The rest of the table also loved their food. The waitress gave great service. Loved how much the restaurant stays true to it\'s Forrest Gump roots as the waitress had us play a Forrest Gump trivia game. My coworker Robb totally owned it... he answered most of them. Anyway cool experience, great food... just stick to beer if you are ordering an adult beverage.', ""Bubba Gump Orlando gets 5 stars from me. It is one of the few restaurants during Halloween Horror Nights that you don't need a reservation for, if tables are all full you can sit at the bar and order food at the bar FYI. The scampi pasta and shrimp New Orleans are both awesome and filling, the New Orleans is not too spicy either. I'd recommend eating here if you need a quicker meal than the other places on city walk but want a sit down as well."", ""The food was horrible and the bill made it worse. I guess I should have known bette, \xa0you don't go there for the food but rather the atmosphere."", ""Was looking for food at universal so I googled best places to eat on city walk. Bubba gump came up & I had always heard great things about it. Also Forrest Gump theming is always a plus. I have to say.... This was one of the worst meals I've ever had. Only come here if you enjoy lukewarm reheated frozen food. The saving grace was the garlic bread. None of our food was crispy, my onion rings were cold and when they remade it, they were still cold! AND they only had Pepsi and not coke! LOL definitely not something I ever thought I'd complain about but after a terrible meal, having to drink a PEPSI was almost my breaking point.

I was disappointed in this visit especially when I have been craving fish n chips. You missed the mark Bubba Gump. This could be my last visit to a bubba gumps. I was hoping for fish and chips but This visit fell short. Way short. As for the wait staff, they were all awesome. Ney was pretty cool too. Thumbs up Ney.""]",negative
"[""I came here for the first time because Lanzhou was closed, and I'm definitely glad I did! \xa0We tried a wide variety of their offerings.Crispy fish fillet - this was delicious and everything I wanted. \xa0Tender fish, crispy outside, perfect flavor.Liang pi cold noodles - this was a surprisingly large portion size given the price and it was one of my favorite dishes. \xa0The noodles have a great chewy texture and the sesame marinade and vegetables are very refreshing. \xa0I would definitely get this again.Biang biang noodles - these were very solid. \xa0I like the noodles more at Lanzhou but these are also good. \xa0I wish they had more meat options like chicken or something (I don't eat lamb). \xa0Someone else got the lamb noodles and said the lamb didn't add much (the flavor was good but the meat quality was not).Pork bun - Pretty lacking in flavor compared to other dishes.Cucumber salad - pretty normal, would have liked if there was some chili oil or something. \xa0Definitely a lot of cucumber.Overall I really liked the cold noodles and the fish fillet -- I would definitely get them next time I go to MDM Noodles!"", ""I tried out take outs from here before and last weekend I had a great indoor dining experience here. To be honest the food was decent enough I've definitely had better noodles, however the great location and service really made this a great location to try some great Chinese noodles.First the foods, I thought the pork burger lacked a bit of spice, the noodles are definitely top notch and I really appreciate the chili oil sauce on top of it. However, I thought the Scallion Beef didn't really go that well with it, feels like two separate dishes combined in one bowl.Aside from those everything else was great. I really enjoyed their friendly service and quite spacious dining area. There's actually parking spaces in the back just for MDM as well.I'd highly recommended their noodle menus as it's really their main strength."", ""Been here multiple times and lately have been going to MDM for dine in to get their wonton noodle soups and wonton soup. \xa0I've also ordered their eggplant, lamb pull noodle, dumplings, and skewers.The soups have a great flavor with multi layer depth. \xa0The hand pull noodles have been fresh with a nice chewy texture. \xa0The skewers are mixed with lean and fatty pieces of meat packed with flavor.The eggplant dish was cooked well with generous serving of sauce. Off street parking lot is behind the restaurant, to access, there's a little alley to the right when you are facing the front of the restaurant."", ""Stopped by MDM Noodles on a weekend visit to Boston and was truly blown away! I'd been craving hand pulled noodles for a while and the tomato and egg one is my absolute favorite so I decided to drag my friend over to MDM. We both got hand pulled noodles as well as the pork burger and pork + cabbage dumplings. Everything was absolutely fabulous and filling. The flavors were on point and everything was perfectly seasoned! Additionally, service was efficient and the food came out quickly! Will definitely be back the next time I'm in the Boston area!"", ""I like this place bc it really has authentic Chinese Northern food!!!!! I go there every time my homesick is hitting.If you are not into Chinese Northern style-that's ok! Then the homemade dumplings are UNIVERSALLY HIGHLY recommended to all of you! Go try the dumplings please!Life is too short just go! there is always nothing wrong with their dumplings!"", ""So delicious! I had gotten recommendations from friends to try this place out and I'm glad that I finally got to go! There's nothing more that I love than noodles. You can never go wrong and the Spicy Boiled Lamb Hand-Pulled Noodles did not disappoint. I would recommend these. Also, this fish filet dish was amazing!!!! I've never had anything like it before. First off, it was MASSIVE. These two dishes fed my boyfriend and I for 2 days. The fish was tender and submerged in a spicy oil which was so yummy over the side of rice served with it. We put some of the oil in our noodles too and *chefs kiss*. Highly recommend these 2 dishes. Can't wait to try more."", ""Favorite stop when I'm in Brighton . The hand pulled noodles are outstanding - we like them spicy but they'll adjust the heat to your preference. Portions are large and prices are very reasonable.

The mala vegetables had a good vegetable variety but was too spicy for my taste.', 'First time ordering take out from here. My friends and I tried their spicy hand pulled noodles along with the tea soaked egg. The prices were fair with the noodles and eggs both about $10.The noodles had a good texture and flavor to them. The tea egg was very subtle in taste, not something I will order again next time. Staff was very friendly and made our orders quickly. Would come back to try more!', ""I keep coming back to this place. Hand pulled noodle is great, burger is awesome, lamb skewers are delicious, dumplings reminds me of home.

"[""I have been to this establishment twice this week whileIn town for business. I recommend going here at least once once if your travels take you to Richmond, or if you live here. Most of the clientele during my visit seemed to be local. This is a small, family owned business with a gracious and pleasant hostess/waitress and a chef d'cuisine who knows his business. They serve a variety of French and French-adjacent (pasta) dishes which are \xa0wonderfully prepared, perfectly seasoned, fresh ingredients, and fantastic value.They offer a'la carte starters, entrees, pastas and desserts, or pick an entree and for $17, pick any starter and dessert. I did this twice. The first night, I ordered from the specials board, and got a perfectly moist inch thick grilled pork chop with mash and veg, started off with corn and seafood chowders and finished with a chocolate soufflé. Out the door with a good tip for about $50 US. Three nights later, I had to come back for the roasted duck breast, started by chipotle shrimp on corn cakes, and once again finished by chocolate soufflé. \xa0(Pics attached). Again, out the door for about $50 US. They seem to be BYOB, I did see someone bring wine. I don't know if there Is a corkage fee. I'd go again if I was staying longer, and I'll be back the next time I'm in town. This place is well worth the short drive out to Road 6."", ""Here is their $45 DOVF menu:Bread & butter (optional), $5 extra, 8.5/10: The salty & hint of sweetness of the shrimp butter went so well w/ the warm bread! Butter was very creamy too. Appetizers:Seafood & corn chowder, 8.5/10: Melts in your mouth! Not too heavy or thick, lots of corn and big pieces of shrimp. Grilled marinated quail w/green salad, 7.5/10: Tender & flavorful, little more gamey compared to regular chicken. Scallop thermidor, 6/10: Scallop was slightly undercooked & didn't go to well w/ the cheese. Salad was good tho! Entrees:Pan roasted duck breast , 8.5/10: Chewy & juicy w/ a slight redness in the middle! Got a little dry towards finishing the dish. Grilled blackened New York steak , 7/10: Very tender, cooked as medium! Found it odd that there's a lot of cajun spice on it, too spicy for our liking. Grilled miso glazed salmon fillet , 9/10: Cooked perfectly soft w/ a little char, the miso mayo made the fillet more rich! All entrees came w/ mashed potatoes, carrot puree, & a variety of veggies. Everything was good but not a fan of the puree cause it lacked flavour.Dessert:Chocolate souffle w/ vanilla ice cream, 8/10: The ice cream balanced out the sweet & bitterness! I also enjoyed the airy outer texture with the lava centre.Orange creme caramel, 7/10: Didn't taste much orange but the caramel wasn't too sweet and the custard was smooth! Mango & blueberry panna cotta, 6/10: Mango puree was fresh & went ok with the panna cotta. Overall nothing special tho. Worth it? Could be better. Pretty much no service..no one refills water or asks how the food is. All the servers do is clean dishes & take your bill. Good part: huge portions for a $45 value, although I wouldn't go back cause their regular menu is expensive. The place is small, 9 tables with plexi glass installed - make resos if you plan to go! DOVF seatings are 5:30pm & 7:30pm."", 'We were looking for a place for dinner before an event and lucked out as they were fully booked. Told the server we will be in and out of them in under an hour and she said if you can be here within 15 mins we do have a table until 7pm.Started with the mussels and corn chowder (the best I have had). The bread is scrumptious and homemade. Mussels were so well flavoured.Out come the duck and boy oh boy, the meat were so tender. Generally, I like my duck medium well but I really enjoyed it in a rarer state. The sauce was so delicious and the sides were ample full.The chocolate soufflé was so satisfying.Basically, it has been a while since a restaurant has nailed every single dish but Shoestring Cafe absolutely did that and the super talented chef did it in under an hour. Thanks to our server for coordinating our dishes in such a timely manner too.', ""The food here was fresh, unique, and generous in portion! I made a reservation here and was so excited for my 3-course feast. My friend and I sat by the window and were almost silent as we savored every bite of our meal. From the fresh french bread with crabby butter at the start of the meal to the delicious desserts we were two very happy ladies!I started with the crab and avocado tower -- so fresh it really seemed like the crab came out of the water that morning! This was a perfect first course. My friend loved her baked scallops as we sat enamored by our food. For the main course my friend had the fresh black cod and I had the shrimp and scallops. The fish was fresh and delicate and the scallops and shrimp I had were perfectly complemented by the sauce and vegetables plated together. Lastly the panna cotta was so thick and creamy I couldn't put it down. Usually it's made very sweet and jiggly - this was not super sweet but just right. I almost didn't finish it but it was so good I couldn't let any go to waste. The cheesecake was light and fluffy - different than the usual dense cheesecakes I've had that are filling and rich. The entire experience was wonderful and I highly recommend this restaurant!! It is small but was full the entire time we were there. It is no secret they are a great restaurant! Can't wait to return in the future! Service was great!"", 'My husband and I visited The Shoestring Cafe for Dine Out Vancouver. This was our second time visiting. Our first time here was a couple years ago and it was a pleasant experience.The first impression when I walked in here this time was ""WOW, IT\'S SO BUSY!"" It\'s a small restaurant and there was so many people inside. The tables were right next to each other and were divided by a plexiglass. Customers were seated so close together that they needed to move the table when they wanted to get out. They also allowed a big group of people to dine in different tables and they were just walking across to other tables to chat with no social distance. I understand that small businesses are doing their best to survive, but they need to put their customers\' and staff\'s safety first.Food quality has seriously gone down since my last visit. Most of the dishes tasted artificial. Perhaps it\'s the seasonings they use. The blueberry & mango Panna cotta was horrible... My husband is the least picky eater I know and he even stopped eating. The chocolate souffle was good. Overall, I would not go back here again. I really hate to leave a negative review during this difficult time, but it just made it impossible to leave a good review. I hope they can assess the situation and make some improvements for future guests.', ""Went here a few days ago with my fiancé for the first time and had the Dine Out Vancouver menu and for $35/person, was well worth it as the portions were big and overall the food was delicious! We got the steak and cod which were both very tender and flavourful (we asked for medium rare for the steak) They ran out of the Grilled Aged New York Steak so gave us the Rib Eye instead which was fine with us when it arrived at our table and we saw how huge it was! The cod portion was understandably smaller and against the steak it looked so little. However, the cod melts in your mouth with each bite and with the appetizers and desserts, I was very full and satisfied.For appetizers, we had the Seafood Chowder which was really tasty and the Quail which also tasted good but was a bit plain on its own. The garlic toast it came with was burnt which is why I didn't give this review a full 5 stars.For desserts, we had Dark chocolate Souflee+Vanilla ice cream and Mango Blueberry Panna Cotta. The souflee was not too sweet so for sweet tooth's, you may find it a bit bitter though it goes well with the ice cream. I personally enjoy less sweet desserts so the dark chocolate was perfect for me. The Panna Cotta was really good and I found it interesting to have the mango blueberry combo but it goes really well together. The strawberry on top was sweet too which makes me happy because sometimes it's just decoration and tastes bad but not in this case.Overall, this was the first Western style food I had in Richmond and I could tell it was more Hong Kong western style which I personally enjoy but there is a difference if you've had both styles of food before.This restaurant is very quaint and isn't very big but we still felt safe dining in during the pandemic as each table had plastic dividers and the staff all wore masks."", ""GREAT FOOD -- WONDERFUL PRESENTATION and well worth a visit. Who would have thought this out-of-the-way restraunt could serve up such high quality food. The only downside is that they do not have a liquor license and it's nice to have a glass of wine/beer with the meal.Try it -- you won't be disappointed!(5 of us were there for Dine Out Vancouver and it was busy, so make reservations!)"", ""We came to this restaurant last New Year's Eve. \xa0They don't have many tables and although I had made reservation for 7:00PM, it took us a while to get seated as previous group were having a party. \xa0We had to wait for a while in the cold because their door kept opening and closing and there's no room to wait inside.I had preordered our orders and I think it was a bad idea as my prime rib was just luke warm. \xa0It didn't help either that they didn't serve it with the horseradish sauce that was supposed to come with it. \xa0I had to wait for the waitress to come around so I can tell her what's missing on my plate and then it took another while before she served it as she didn't do it right away. \xa0In the meantime, my prime rib was getting colder by the minute. \xa0The fat on my prime rib was congealing.I emailed the chef/owner about this mistake and I never heard an apology from him at all. \xa0Food was good but not quite. \xa0Would I bother to go back, I don't think so."", 'First day for Dineout Vancouver!We read some reviews and this seemed to be a great start... and having lobster as an appie piqued my interest. We started with that and it was delicious. Very well cooked and exactly how you want lobster, succulent and juicy! It also came with a corn cake aka cornbread pancake. Unexpectedly good!Next up was their grilled miso cod with vegetables. The skin was nicely grilled and crispy while keeping the rest of the fish just right. We also order the duck breast which was excellent. Cooked well and not overdone. The sauce had a greatly earthy taste that complemented the duck well. Lastly, we had the mango blueberry panna cotta. Wow! Fresh mango and the custard was perfect. Not overly sweet and the fresh mango was delicious. Also ordered the chocolate soufflé which was a bit dry and overcooked :(All in all, a great meal and looking forward to coming back.', ""We came here for the Dine Out Vancouver 2020 menu tonight. First time dining here and looked forward to a good dinner. Driving here it's a bit out of the way in a light industrial area. We were quickly seated as we had reservations and we were a few minutes early. Shortly after, the restaurant was quite full. The restaurant isn't really big but it felt very cozy. We ordered:- appetizer: Grilled Chipotle Marinated Lobster Tail and Corn Cake - this was really good. The lobster tail the the corn cake was really delicious with the marinated sauce. With a small salad it was a great start- entree1: Pan Roasted Duck Breast - I really love duck, especially from Chinese restaurants, but this very tasty with the sauce that was provided on the dish.- entree2: Black Alaska Cod - first bite of this, I was in love \xa0I do love eating fish and this was quite rich tasting but it was very tender and melted happily at each bite. - dessert1: Panna Cotta - I really liked this dessert \xa0as it was not overly sweet really paired \xa0well with mango and bluberry- dessert 2 - chocolate soufflé with ice cream - I had a couple bites and it was ok only because soufflé was a smidge over baked.

"[""If there's any restaurant in Chinatown that deserves style points, it's Double Chin. They have old favorites (Beef Chow Fun), play-on old favorites (Char Siu Pineapple Bun), random fusion dishes (Kimchi Alfredo), and dishes that purely confuse (Double Chinwich???).On pure taste, Double Chin is pretty good. The later in the evening you go, the better the food seems to taste - they're open until 4am Fridays and Saturdays. For a late night snack, I recommend the HK French Toast. It's filling, sweet, shareable, and just SCREAMS decadence."", 'I would give 3.5 stars. Double Chin is THE place to go after the clubs and night life closes in Boston. Food I\'ve tried:- The menu is quite extensive, and there a surprising number of fusion foods. I do appreciate their creativity in their menu!- WATERMELON BOMBER ($34): a classic scorpion bowl served in a watermelon. The alcohol is deceptively hidden in the sweetness of the drink, so proceed with caution. Overall, not to sweet and quite refreshing. - SKILLET LOBSTER ""MAC"" N CHEESE ($16): the cheese is pretty thick and gooey. I didn\'t really taste the lobster part too much. Flavor wise is pretty standard for mac n cheese. - SCALLION PANCAKE ($8): it is crispy, with enough thickness to have the chewiness. It tastes like a standard scallion pancake. - STIR FRIED SHIN RAMEN ($11): I liked the presentation of having the ramen cup come with the dish. Flavor wise, it is exactly as advertised, shin ramen stir fried with veggies. I did appreciate that the veggies were not overly cooked and they retained their crunchiness.- WOK CHARRED GARLICKY BOK CHOY ($10): you can never go wrong with bok choy. The sauce is very garlicky, and the bok choy soaks it all up. There is a greasy component as well since it is stir fried in oil, so I wouldn\'t exactly call this a healthy option. However, it is still delicious. \xa0- SRIRACHA HONEY POPCORN CHICKEN ($8): the meat was on the drier side. There was a balance of sweetness and the spiciness, though I did not find this to be spicy at all. Personally, I thought it could have had a touch more sweetness. - Overall, I felt that the flavors were ok. I was more excited about the prospect of getting the food and the envisioned flavors that were described in the menu, than the actual moment of eating the food. Atmosphere:- Since this becomes the hang out area for those enjoying the night life, it can get pretty rambunctious during the peak hours of Friday, Saturday after midnight. This is also the only time I have been here, so I cannot really comment on how the atmosphere would be during their regular business hours.Service:- The staff is pretty accommodating to large groups.Overall:- I appreciate the innovation of the menu, but the flavors were ok. Nothing ever tastes bad, but the flavors are never as I had imagined them to be. - Would I visit for the food during regular business hours? Probably not. Will this continue to be the go to place after a night out in Boston? Definitely.', ""There aren't many places in Chinatown open after an evening show, and this time we chose to go to Double Chin. \xa0I'm glad we did! \xa0It really hit the spot. \xa0Though it took a bit of time to get the waiter's attention, the food came out super quickly and we were in and out in around 35 minutes. \xa0Rice rolls in XO Sauce ($14) - this was definitely a highlight. \xa0Super tender and chewy rice rolls pan-fried to perfection with delicious marinade and fresh bean sprouts. \xa0Couldn't ask for anything more!Pork and shrimp wonton noodle soup ($10) - Nice and thin egg noodles, comforting warm soup, and well-cooked and plentiful yu choy. \xa0The wontons were okay -- definitely big, not much shrimp, mostly pork. \xa0Pretty good deal and very filling -- didn't realize it would come with so many vegetables which we appreciated!Crispy chili chicken ($13) - The flavors here were good (love the chilis, savoriness), but the chicken left something to be desired. \xa0It was a bit tough and the coating was more of a tapioca or potato starch and not particularly crispy. \xa0Still a yummy dish!Overall I was pleasantly surprised by the offerings at Double Chin. \xa0The rice rolls were perfect and I really enjoyed everything else too. \xa0It'll be a tossup between Taiwan Cafe and Double Chin next time I'm in Chinatown at night!"", ""Awesome! Was here tonight with a few friends and the service absolutely made the meal. I sadly didn't catch her name, but the waitress working tonight (with IMPECCABLE EYELASHES might I add) was beyond friendly and helpful with the menu. Constantly checked on us, offered advice, and even subbed out my drink when it wasn't to my liking. Not super loud, and pretty chill ambiance for a Friday night. If nothing else, come here for the staff and the booze. Super creative drinks, and the boozy boba is to die for."", 'Eating at Double Chin is truly an experience!! I first found out about the restaurant through the Fung Bros\' youtube videos on hidden gems in Boston chinatown. When I first saw Double Chin appear, I thought ""hmm, I\'ve never heard of the store"" but upon hearing Gloria, the owner, speak about the store and her aspirations with it, I was moved by how she wished to connect her American and Asian roots and bring tasty foods from her childhood onto an actual restaurant menu. It was about representation and shining light on this bicultural identity, and I really identified with that passion of theirs as a Chinese-American as well and wanted to support that. I first came a few weeks ago, bringing 2 other friends. We already had so many foods from the menu that we wanted to try and came prepared! However, showing up, the menu had so many MORE enticing items that we just couldn\'t leave without trying. We ended up leaving with 7 dishes total for us 3 along with a BIG cube toast and boba drinks...and boy, we were so full but we just had to go full out and try everything we did. We later came back again a week or 2 ago. There are many popular fusion spots in big cities that appear nice and aesthetic but don\'t really deliver. However, this spot in particular, the food looks nice AND tastes good!! Everything was enjoyable. I really enjoyed the uniqueness of how certain menu items combined different Asian and American ingredients. My favorites were probably the Elote fried rice and the Skillet mac n cheese with the rice noodles! Both just had such addicting flavors, it was hard to stop eating either of them, even when I was full. I probably wouldn\'t get the shin ramyun noodles or peking duck fries again personally! For drinks, the capri fun SPF 60 was really tasty, and I\'m not normally an alcoholic drinker. Another fun part was that my group and I even got to converse w/ the owner Gloria for a while, who shared with us her goals in designing and creating Double Chin, and she was so lovely to speak with!Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience there. It was such a fun time, and the workers and owner there are so nice! On one hand, I feel like they have the potential to be so big but on another hand, I secretly also like having Double Chin as a secret hangout spot that I don\'t want overly crowded...I will for sure be back often and raving about the place!!', ""We checked out Double Chin and left a little disappointed. I was hoping that this punny little spot would be my new late night go to. Double Chin is a pun because it's named for the two owners Emily and Gloria Chin AND one could get a double chin eating like this daily. We got there early because we expected a dinner rush and we were right. We arrived at 5:30pm and by the time we left at 7:00pm the restaurant was full of millennial aged patrons.We got the Shin Ramen Stirfry, the Peking Duck Fries (with just a smidge of Peking duck), Satay Noodles (not photographed) and the Macaron Madness. The noodles and fries were just as expected and definitely IG worthy as promised. There was nothing special of note as far as flavours were concerned. The Macaron Madness cube toast didn't disappoint with its Instagram worthiness but it did fall short on flavour. The batter used had that overpowering eggy taste (think sulphur) that one doesn't expect from a well done French toast batter and the taste of the oil from the deep fryer was overly evident (they might want to change the oil pronto). The service was slow and it appeared that they forgot part of our order as the bill was placed on our table before we got the item. It was only when we asked if the item was still on its way did it arrive 10 minutes later after some hubbub at the register. \xa0We sat for about 30 minutes waiting for it overall. All of the other items came within 10 minutes of ordering them. If you're looking for a trendy, Instagram worthy spot, this is definitely for you. We were not impressed but will give another try in a few months. Hopefully we won't feel then that we paid a hefty price for IG photos rather than a meal worth the listed price points."", ""Last night I needed something quick and was craving Chinese food and everything in Chinatown was closed besides this place. I ordered the lobster fried rice and added shrimp. I got home ready to chow down and the rice looked and tasted bland and flavorless. I did not see any lobster meat in the rice either. The rice had a strange taste that I could not put my finger but I've never had lobster/shrimp fried rice that tasted like that before. It addition to the strange taste, the rice tasted like it was mixed with dirt. It was very gritty and sandy. I couldn't eat the rest of it and I ended up tossing it. My sister had a similar dish and did not like her food so I definitely would not recommend this place."", ""My friends and I stopped by here after bar hopping. I always wanted to try this place out and love that it's open until 4am on Fridays and Saturdays. My group was slightly larger so the staff took some time to arrange the tables for us. Some of the tasty items that were ordered included the Lobster Rangoons, Calamari, and Shrimp Fried rice. The prices were a lil high and I believe we had to spend a minimum per person, but it was worth it after a long night out."", ""THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! Great service and wonderful drinks. I'd highly recommend Double Chin for an evening out with some great friends."", ""Stopped by this cute fusion cafe for a quick lunch while in town and had a good experience! The menu is pretty large so it took me and my dining partner a while to decide on what to order but we were happy with our choices. We ordered Poutine Your Mouth and Spicy Rice Cakes to share. The poutine is crispy waffle fries with a cheese sauce, kimchi, and furikake sprinkled on top. These were good and the flavors complimented each other really well. I feel like the sauce could be spread more evenly but the fries are great on their own as well so I can't be mad at it lol The rice cakes were SO good. They were fried so they were slightly crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. They put mozzarella cheese \xa0and thinly sliced Chinese sausage on top which went really well with the sauce. I do wish there was a little more sausage but overall this was a really good dish! We didn't try any of the desserts but I'll definitely come back for those. This is a good place for a quick snack or meal and they're open fairly late if you want a late bite. Check them out if you're in the area!""]",negative
"['We had just arrived in downtown for the weekend and walked to Cactus Club for a late lunch. We got there around 1p on a Friday. Ended up putting out name on a waitlist, but then asked if we could just sit at the bar top. Oddly this was the only restaurant we went to all weekend that didn\'t reserve bar tops for reservations (or maybe it was just the time of day). I\'m a sucker for Frosé even when it\'s cold and their Frosé sangria sounded perfect for me. It was a little disappointing as there was maybe an ounce of Frosé to the larger sangria amount. It had great flavor, but just wished it was more of a half and half thing. My boyfriend had the special margarita. It had an interesting salt rimmer and a fruity taste. Wasn\'t anything special to us though. He was torn between a few different bowls and the bartender offered up an off the menu bowl they were trialing. He ordered it and loved it! There was a really good saffron and turmeric taste to the rice. The beet hummus was smooth. Their homemade falafel was also really delicious! I little too much parsley for my liking but you did get a little mint undertone as well. Was a really good dish that I\'m sure would go over well. Not much to say about my burger. I was just craving it and it was a standard impossible burger with sweet potato fries. Really appreciated the conversation and friendly bartender! She was super helpful and gave us some really good restaurant recommendations for the rest of our stay. Wish I remembered her name, but we appreciated her!! I know this is a chain in the area, but it has a great selection/variety of food and drinks is you\'re looking for simple ""American/Canadian"" food. The prices are also fair.', ""Had a high school friend in town from PEI and we decided to go to the Cactus Club Coal Harbour for dinner. I was able to find decent, inexpensive, parking nearby. I was very impressed on how efficient the hostesses were checking our vaccine passports and ID. We had a reservation so we were taken to our table by one of the kind young ladies. Our sever was great as was the food. Whatever they do to the asparagus made me want a whole lot more lol. The downside was halfway through someone turned up the music to the point where my friend and I couldn't hear one another. I asked someone, that wasn't our server, if it could be turned down and the way they handled it wasn't that great. Was told that they had to keep the atmosphere for all tables so she didn't think it could be turned down. We weren't even sitting close to the bar side. We then asked our server, who admitted it was loud, and she had it turned down. I will probably go again when my friend is in town but not 100% sure I would go on my own. For the most part it was a positive experience but would prefer not to have to yell across the table to have a conversation, especially in a restaurant."", 'We were vising Vancouver for the first time and were told that visiting Cactus Club was a must. \xa0We chose this location because of the views, and when we made reservations (which is highly requested), we did request to be by the windows. \xa0They did their best to accomodate, and although we were not right next to the window, we were close enough to have it part of our views. \xa0We sat in a nice booth that was very roomy for 4 of us, and my son and husband sat in chairs at the end.The restaurant is beautiful, including the bathrooms.The food is also deliscious. \xa0We ordered the poke bowl, impossible burger and tofu lettuce wraps to share. \xa0The tofu wraps was actually very spicy, even for me, but was great.We also ordered dessert to share as well.Great customer service and experience!', ""Love love love this cute restaurant!

The shrimp was cooked to perfection - well seasoned and not even a little bit too dry"", ""One line review: Wonderful.We were looking for a place to celebrate a friend's graduation and birthday. My wife came up with this spot, and it was a big win.We arranged reservations online for the patio, and even though we had to change the reservation at one point, everything was seamless. Covid restrictions are now loosening, but we were very glad to have a spot on the patio \xa0-- all the more on a warm, clear, sunny day. It was glorious!Our experience entering the restaurant was relatively painless. They have a line at lunchtime, even on a Monday, but we were able to come in with a very short wait and join our friend who was already at the table.We ordered:- Hunter chicken- Rainforest greens with chicken- Feenie Burger, lettuce-wrapped- Lava cake with ice cream- Surprise complimentary cheesecake birthday dessertI would order any of those things again. The food was excellent, and the portion was fair.We got killed on parking at Waterfront Centre (over $20 for 2.5 hours); much better to park at the Vancouver Convention Centre -- cheaper ($10 for 3 hours) and closer. Our server Julian was excellent. He was patient, offered good suggestions, helped us make selections, was accommodating, and surprised us with the birthday dessert (and the right one at that!). Hard to imagine it being better.The patio is fantastic. We were out by the fountain but within view of North Vancouver and the snow-tipped mountains and the water. Our friend uses a wheelchair, and that was no problem on their patio. Getting to the bathroom was a bit more of a challenge, given that the elevator was down. She and my wife actually went across the way at the convention centre.Pricing was premium for our budget, even at lunch, but decidedly worth it. Bottom line: A great spot for a special occasion."", ""Glad that this location is still open, but being the first time back since covid and we were surprised by the changes. Cactus club was booming with business per usual but the dining experience was not. We arrived and our names were taken down, it was around a 45 minute wait. This is about a normal wait time on a busy weekend evening. When we were seated to our surprise it was outside. The surprise was due to the seating on the patio being under plastic tents that had heating only under the tents. Our table for 2, was not under the heating lamps. We asked to move and were reseated at a larger table still under the patio, but with more heating. It was still cold to say the least. I asked if there was any blankets as there is a cold breeze throughout the patio due to it snowing outside with the ocean breeze. They are not doing blankets as of covid. \xa0Our server was named Julien, they were very considerate and I would recommend them as your server! We were told that we would be able to have a seat inside and we moved in. Sadly our table was a little forgotten about by our server, there was no quality check or water refill. If you intend to go out to dinner with a loved one we highly recommend making a reservation, and that it be in the dining side of the restaurant. If you're sitting on the patio anticipate wearing your coat as the heating lamps are insufficient."", 'My sister and I always go to different cactus clubs in the city to catch up. Last Saturday we chose the Coal Harbour location and Judy helping us. She was FANTASTIC. Such an amazing service, sociable and she made us feel at home. We promised each other to go back to CC in Coal Harbour hoping to get the same experience that Judy provided us with. 1000000% recommended']",positive
"[""Quick and good! Stopped in on my way home as I saw this place everyday to and from work for years. It's a small restaurant with a tight parking lot, but only took 10-15 to order and get my food. I waited a couple of minutes as the lady was taking a phone order and waited 10 minutes in my car before going back back in (they said 10-15 for it to be ready). As I went in the guy bagged my order and confirmed it before I went on my way. There were a lot of Togo orders and people that ordered ahead, which I would recommend as it's small on the inside and busy. I ordered the cheese lasagna which was still hot and delicious by the time I got home. The garlic bread was crisp and flavorful. The menu had a variety of items that sounded wonderful from hot and cold sandwiches, salads, and pizza. I don't eat a lot of meat but will definitely be back to try more things soon!"", ""On a spur decision, tried Geraldi's and we drove past at first though found our way. Wasn't too hungry but stepping inside and smelling freshly made pizza- got my attention!Took a minute to see what to order and got a 14inch (8 thin slices) half pesto veggie and half pepperoni. As well as a whole chicken parmeroni. While waiting for our food, lots of customers picking up orders that were done either online or called in. Pesto veggie was just right! The pepperoni was nice too, big slices and not as salty. Both pizzas left me feeling full though not too stuffed.The cheese on the pizzas didn't stay gooey as we had a little bit of a drive and they don't do individual slices of pizza. For half and half pizzas, you pay the difference of the cheaper one which works out.A satisfying dinner that was prepared by a small business and hard working employees."", ""I added pictures a few years ago but guess I didn't leave a review.

As a parent you have two speeds of eating food. Feast mode and ""I will never finish this"" I had a stop or two to make with the kid. So my sandwich was a little cold when I ate it so I went Feast Mode. It did not feel good, but that\'s my fault. I\'m guessing there is something to be said about the Chicago beef when you have the hot juice dripping down your hands. Even for a longtime sitting, the bread held up pretty good. I mean the outside was still crispy and the inside not to soggy. I got the Chicago beef with Italian sausage. I think there was a little bit of seasoning missing maybe but overall a good sandwich. I\'d love to come back for a hot one.', 'So we have made a few visits over the past year as we sought out more places to get food during the Covid. \xa0We have known this place for years but never checked it out, why? Being dumb I guess :)Service is top notch, always friendly when we have gone in to pick up an order. \xa0We ordered online and in person and the food is pretty quick to get.The Sandwiches are awesome, so far we have got the Meatball, Geraldi Chicken (new fav), Geraldi Spicy, Chicago Beef and finally grabbed a slice of Pep on the last trip. I am going to order full pie next time. \xa0The sandwiches are a great value in quality and quantity for the price. \xa0Great flavor in each bite. \xa0I watched many customers go in and out while waiting for sandwiches and it is definitely a place for regulars as many folks they know by name. Sure wish we had gone here sooner then just last year.', ""A very nice and cozy,old school Italian sub shop. It's simple and good. I'll be back."", 'I have had 2 Italian beef sandwiches (Geraldi\'s chicago beef sandwich) since moving to the PNW 3 years ago. I of course moved from the Chicagoland area and have high standards for Italian Beef. I had one sandwich from a cart and it was just ok. Geraldi\'s was much, much better. We are in Vancouver, but I will happily drive down again just to get it again.First, they start with a crusty bread which is perfect. It comes with cheese and hot peppers, but that\'s not how I prefer it. I have always had it with Giardinera peppers and mozzarella. In the Midwest, I always declined it being ""wet"" because that\'s where they basically dip the whole sandwich in the jus and it ends up being soggy. Well, I would say my sandwich from Geraldi\'s was a little bit on the dry side and would probably ask for extra jus next time. They were able to make the changes which was nice. My only other complaint is that they don\'t have fries. To be perfect, it would be crinkly cut fries, though beggars can\'t be choosers. Please bring in any sort of fries and it would be heaven!TL DR; Yes, it\'s a good italian beef sandwich for you Chicago transplants. It\'s worth the trip.']",positive

Not this lady! The 1st thing that caught our attention was that my aunt every week orders coffee and a side of milk. Servers then bring her coffee with milk but never a side of milk, we've had coffee and creamers show up ( which she tells the servers not creamer). No one seems to remember or listen. Today for the 1st time we had someone bring coffee and then a separate cup with milk like she asked. Both my aunt and I did a double take. \xa0This was the 1st time since November ( when we started coming here) that someone got it right! \xa0This was a huge deal for us. She kept checking on our drinks and took our order. Alex came by to refill my aunts coffee and my Diet Coke while waiting consistently and with a smile. Food came out and it was great as always. For the most part service is good here. Today it was executed excellently. . I normally write reviews based on food and service. Today I'm going to give praise to an excellent server and her skill set.

More COVID fallout, I'm sure, but personally, HH was the main if not the only reason we have been coming here for many years-- due to their ongoing history of rather high prices. So now we will have to find a more reasonably priced location to get our fix of traditional ceviche. I'd point out to management that the place was mostly deserted so perhaps HH was more of a draw than they realized.Small thing: we were provided with a bar napkin under our glasses of ice water, but none under our cocktails for unknown reasons.

"[""**Pre Covid19 Review**Came here for their lunch buffet (14.50 or 13.05 with Encore Rewards Card) because I heard it was a pretty good value for a decent buffet. Coming to the buffet, I knew it wasn't a Vegas style buffet obviously, though overall, it wasn't too bad either for the price.The lunch buffet seems to be a mix of lunch and breakfast. For breakfast items, they had some thinly sliced french toast, breakfast potatoes, breakfast sausage, eggs, and bacon. The bacon was a bit soft as were the potatoes, though that's probably just due to being in the warming tray. The sausage is of your usual breakfast variety. Chicken was pretty moist, though maybe could've stood to use a bit more seasoning. I loved the potato salad though lol. I've got a weakness for potato salad, and it was sure darn creamy and tasty. I also tried their Mushroom and Onion bisque. Was a bit salty but was overall tasty enough. They also had one of those cool pop dispensers where you can choose your pop and add flavour shots in it...freedom of choice has never felt so good. Located next to it was an instant Nestle coffee machine that could dispense coffee, instant cappuccinos, instant lattes, etc.For desserts, they had some profiteroles and cake/bar squares that reminded me a bit of the ones from Superstore lol. The ice cream machine was good though (why choose between just chocolate or vanilla? SWIRL!)"", ""The night we went, there was a young Asian dude at the carving station. He was G R U M P Y. I asked for the roast and not only did he not smile, he sneered at me and tossed me a few slim shavings of meat. I wish I could say that I am just trying to be funny, but unfortunately I'm not. I continued to watch him from my seat and he was just NOT in a good mood at all. He did similar if not the same to other people. He would trade places every 30 minutes or so with another guy. There was HUGE and noticeable difference between servers. The other guy was very proud of his work station and cleaned up around the area while waiting for the next customer. I'll pass on this place for future events."", ""I can't complain the food quality and variety because I came here after I got Encole card's 1 for 2 coupon.

I enjoyed the pop machine. I used to drink Mello Yellow when I was kid but believed it was discontinued at 33-35 years ago in Japan. What a surprise that I found it again at this buffet! Also Diet Mello Yellow too. Yes I enjoyed the pop without guilty. Please check the machine. So fun!About the food, I loved their chana masala. I had in the soup bowl twice. Very rich and creamy.

I find the food quality here slightly better than at Starlight. I have been here a few times now, and everything just seemed a touch better -- service, place, decor, food and variety. Even the clientele seemed different. I would not really say they are much better as we recently encountered a couple who pretended they did not understand us when told they took our table. Basically they removed our bowl of soup and cup of coffee and sat there. They did not even change the receipt, so we were at the table with their receipt. The staff was apologetic about it but did not really do anything either. Maybe they were the high rollers as their receipt showed they paid the full price (minus encore card discount, not BOGO) for the meal. Anyway, back to the food. If you have been to the buffet at Starlight, you would know the food there was really mediocre with many items being overcooked or mushy. The highlight there was really the roast beef and maybe meatballs and chow mein. So I based my review and experiences here with that. The roast beef here was good, with the middle part being rare and medium and the outer area well done. The staff was accommodating on which cut you prefer. During surf and turf dinner night, it was deep fried shrimps and some parts were so crispy you could eat the shell too. There were also clams and mussels which made my day.Mexican Night had soft taco which you fill it yourself with at least 4 types of meat fillings. Love the tortilla chips and guac and sour cream. Italian Night had a few varieties of pasta. I liked the brussel sprouts, calamari, meatloaf and meatballs too. The artichoke salad was also good. The main cakes for the dessert section changed all the time. I did not really like the soft serve ice cream. There was also the machine for coffee selection like mocha, cappuccino, latte and hot chocolate. Overall, this place has decent buffet food, and worth it if you have the BOGO or discount coupon.

My husband had a free buffet coupon, and I had 5$ off, plus my Rewards card discount making itA total of 10$ for us both - and even that was too much ! First off - the ""salad bar"" didn\'t even have enough things to make any kind of decent salad. Then, the tortillas were so dried out and old - it was like they had taken them out of a freezer, then they sat out too long, re froze again - then served. So awful they didn\'t even wrap around to make a taco. Then the taco filling ( ground beef and pork ) both tasted like cheap meat and the flavour of both was non existent - gross. The roasted Brussels sprouts were edible but slightly burnt, yet cold. The empanadas were disgusting. As was anything else there. I gave up and just had dessert . I had the frozen soft serve ice cream which was the best thing they had.

If you want sugar-Free like myself, go for espresso then add heavy cream.I am used to eating real food like real meat. And the lowest processed food I go is A&W, so my body was in a kind of repulsive mode when I tried to force it to take in highly processed sausages.The one item I need to point out is the horrible pancakes that were stiff like thick cardboard-seemed like someone forgot to put baking powder to create the puffiness.

The staff did not apologize for the lateness. We also were ID upon entering the casino in order to get to the buffet. The security staff scanned our driver license and asked for second piece of ID. So if you must get your buffet there, do not roll out of bed and go, make sure you have two pieces of ID.For $15 of a buffet where I don't want to eat more due to poor quality of food, I don't think I will be back. Rather pay for more and have better quality food at A&W.""]",negative

There are multiple stores across FL and I was glad I tried it out.I had a custom made deep fried sushi burrito ($12 ish-- had to pay $2 for a deep frying option). I like that the store is pretty much self service..so you can just walk up to a tablet and spend time picking and customize your food to however you like. The food portion for a fried burrito was actually quite big. It could be 1.5-2 meals for me. The ingredients seemed fresh and I liked that they gave you a few sauces to eat it with, too.There were a few things I didn't like. 1. Service was slow (like any other places...they were short-staffed due to COVID) and 2. the customization can really add up if you aren't careful with what you are adding/picking. Else, everything else checks out for a no frills eating joint for me!"", ""The food is amazing and the people are super nice. I eat here everytime I'm in FL. They never fail to impress me."", ""Sus Hi Eatstation is official. I was in Orlando with the fam, coming back from Universal Studios. We were staying in Disney resorts, but looking to find something good outside of the resort and found this spot on the way back. I was actually challenged by my wife and sister to find a good sushi spot, and it took about 30 seconds to find this spot. I was sold once I saw the sushi burritos. The staff was friendly. The ordering process was really cool. You basically just select what you want on a tablet, and submit it. The food takes about 15 minutes, but its well worth the wait. I couldn't get the names of everything we had, but i got a sushi burrito that was fried, and my wife got a bowl. all the ingredients were fresh, and it all tasted amazing. Even the loaded rice fries were delicious."", 'Glad we had the chance to stop by here for a quick meal. This place is pretty awesome for lunch and has some solid sushi. There are plenty of options and interesting things to try on the menu. We decided to go with the party in my mouth bowl and the fry me a river burrito. Our wait time was 15 minutes but we got our food sooner than that. Both choices have the perfect blend of cream, sauce, and crunch. The fry me a river burrito was deep fried and had a faultless crisp. Word of advice, the entrees are pretty heavy, so you can split them with someone else.', ""My wife and I have been coming to Sus Hi's around Orlando for years and absolute love the franchise. The food is always consistent and plentiful and we love how many options there for proteins, add ons and sauces. I always try something new in my bowls when I come. The only reason I knocked off a star is that the prices have raising over the last year or so and that we waited for 20 minutes for my food. We will still continue to come often as we love the food."", 'Amazing food and service! The ninjas who helped us were Metal, Creed, and Purp and they were fantastic!', '*** To go order*** The party in your mouth bowl is excellent! The sauce that is on there is sweet with a little tang.

No matter which location you go to, there's always a friendly greeting when you walk in the door and awesome artwork on the walls. I really like being able to order at the kiosk as well. Every bowl I've ever gotten there always taste amazing, fresh, saucy and delicious. I love that I could put all my favorite toppings and mix-and-match. There's always a lot of food and I have enough for two meals when I order a large bowl. I'm sorry I didn't any photos.

The layout of the building is very modern and the chairs and tables are spread out so they are properly socially distanced.As someone who is of the volition that less is more, it was a little bit overwhelming to see the menu and choose from so many options. Especially since the menu was totally digital. It would have been nice to see a more hand held version of the menu. (I may have not seen it, it not apologies.)

"['Banh Mi! :3 Baguette house is a great spot for Vietnamese sandwiches (Banh Mi). They do have other types of orders like croissants, spring rolls, and smoothies but I usually go there for their sandwiches. The one I recommend is the ""house special"" since it\'s just a mixture of multiple types of meat. My friends enjoy their BBQ pork one but I\'ve never tried. The sandwiches averages around to $6 depending on the type of meat you would like. Since sandwiches are easy to make, there\'s not much of a wait when you put in your order. The other item I recommend is their ""pate chaud"". Basically a hot meat pastry, they do it really well and I heard it usually runs out! (Luckily not for me every-time I go. Depends on later in the day I guess. ) Would recommend taking it home since it\'s just more comfortable like that vs the small tables provided inside.', 'I tried the House Combination Special and it was everything a good bahn mi should be. The bread was crunchy and chewy, the different cuts of meat matched perfectly with the crunchy carrots, cilantro, and jalapeños.The service was also super fast and very efficient, we were in and out for a weekend lunch takeout order in 5 minutes.', ""We decided to give Baguette House a try because I wanted to see what the bánh mì in Austin was like. Well, to say the least, I was a bit disappointed. We ordered the House Special Combination Baguette, House Combination Baguette, BBQ Pork Baguette, Meatball Baguette, Pork Steam Bun, and Avocado Smoothies.To give a little background about myself: I absolutely love bánh mì and have tried a variety of them, from different places -- Vietnam; Dong Phuong Bakery in New Orleans, LA; Quoc Bao in Garland, TX; and a couple of others in California. There was nothing really special about the bánh mì at Baguette House. The House Special Combination, House Combination Baguette, and Meatball Baguette were fairly underwhelming. I wish it had more flavor. The BBQ Pork Baguette was the best bánh mì out of all that we ordered. All of the bread was also fairly crispy.The Pork Steam Bun was not good at all, and I'd go as far as to say that it wasn't worth it. It tasted old and soggy, though the staff heated it for me right then and there. I will say that the Pork Steam Bun is fairly cheap in comparison to other bakeries, though. The Avocado Smoothie was also not something worth getting. We couldn't taste the Avocado flavor, but we definitely tasted a flavor of vanilla ice cream. \xa0Powder or not, it didn't taste or resemble an Avocado Smoothie.Moving on to the customer service -- although the staff member assisted me with my order, I felt like I was unwanted. I walked in, and because it was my first time, I asked her if she could wait a moment. I immediately saw an eye roll -- that should have warranted us to leave, but because we were already there, might as well try out the food. As I proceed to place my order with her, she seemed very uninterested and kept looking at my friends and not me, though I was the one placing the order. There was no one else there except for us, so it's not like something was too interesting that she couldn't even be bothered with. Baguette House was a place I really wanted to visit because I wanted to try Vietnamese food in Austin. Little did I know it was a disappointment. If you visit Baguette House and would like to try a bánh mì, I'd recommend the BBQ Pork Baguette since it was the best I've tried. I also wanted to try the Pate So, but they ran out by the time I came. The big reason for the rating is due to the customer service and then the food. No one wants to walk inside a business and feel unwelcome, but that's exactly how I felt, whether I spoke English/Vietnamese to the staff member who took the order. The bánh mì, for what you get: quality and amount, is fairly expensive. I've been to better places, with cheaper bánh mì and discounts (i.e. Buy 3 Get 1 Free)."", ""I came here for the first time and ordered over the phone a house special banh mi, the #5 (bbq pork), the Thai tea with bubbles, and pork (nem nuong) spring rolls. My favorite was the nem nuong rolls. There were 3 rolls and they were huge! Staff was super friendly and the food was prepared quickly. I do take off one star because the banh mi bread was not crunchy and a bit chewy kind of like it was made several hours prior. Traditionally fresh banh mi is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It shouldn't be chewy but nevertheless everything else tasted great and I would come back and give this place another try!"", ""I'll miss this place when I move. \xa0The baguette is the most important part of making these banh mi sandwiches delicious (debatable, don't fight me) and they use delicious baguettes. \xa0The ingredients are fresh and proteins are tasty. \xa0The food is ready right on time in the time frames that give you and the staff is friendly. \xa0There's not a single thing about this place that I can find issue with. \xa0If I make it back by soon, I'll probably try some of their baked goods as well. \xa0Also, do order a Thai Iced Tea as well. \xa0Thank me later."", ""My new go-to bahn mi place!!I tried the #1 and #11 bahn mis and they were both delicious. The bread is their toasted baguette which is wonderfully toasted crunchy outside and soft inside. The meats were well flavored and veggies tasted good too! I highly recommend getting the veggies on the side so your sandwich doesn't get soggy on the drive home. Trust me, it makes a huge difference.The inside was clean with a few spaces to sit. They also had a bunch of house made desserts available for purchase I definitely will go back and try! The staff were helpful and friendly, and the food came out quick. Highly recommend (:"", ""Banh Mi here is good I will give them that. They're the go-to for my family and I, but in regards to drinks I wouldn't recommend. The cup was full of ice and after 2 sips the drink was gone. Our family of 4 was unable to try out a sip each of the nuoc mia we got. It was something that we saw was a recent beverage option and we wanted to try it out. They have my business food-wise, but after trying out the nuoc mia we were disappointed to say the least. $7.00 for a cup of ice was NOT what we had originally ordered. And after scrolling through and skimming through other reviews of the beverages here on yelp, it seems to be a common theme that all the drinks come with so much ice and mainly ice in most cases."", ""This is the only Banh Mi shop I'll come to in Austin. They offer a variety of Vietnamese sandwiches and little bites that remind me of home. I'm a fan of the simple growing up with these, the Pork Patty with Pate Sandwich. However, for those looking for the more familiar, they also serve the BBQ Pork Sandwich or Combination Sandwich. Warning: not meant for lactose intolerants or those allergic to dairy, we learned the hard way. They use the same utensils to spread butter, and to also grab your meats."", ""I love this shop for their delicious and affordable banh mis. It's very simple to order through google and you can save time because they can get a line during lunch time. Plus they can run out of items.The bahn mis include their homemade Mayo and pate.Since I had to make a trip I ordered my sandwiches with the pickles on the side. Pate chaud, the meat pie encrusted with puff pastry was buttery, flaky, greasy deliciousness. I had never had one before and felt bad the first time I ordered because our order wiped them out for the day. So if you want one of those you've got to get there early. The sandwiches were all about $5 or less. The pate chaud was $2.5.They have other desserts, special drinks, and more. You won't be disappointed."", ""So if you come here with your spouseAnd while here you see a small mouseDon't post it on YelpCause that just won't helpTo bring business to the Baguette HouseThis is in a secret little part of Austin that is a mini Chinatown, and that reminds me of Houston. Lots of Vietnamese people live and work and own businesses up here, and they are served well by this wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shop with cheap Banh Mi that are delicious and excellent.I can't give it any less than a 5.""]",positive
"[""Sick little place Good options for some brunch, they have a good amount of veggie/vegan options but nothing excessivePlenty of seating outside, fairly limited inside seating Food took a while, but it's a Saturday morning and they're obviously busyFood was great, I got the MoneyBall (over easy egg on some biscuits and gravy) and I'm picky about my biscuits and gravy Would recommend, check it out if you're in the area!Also, no Nazi punks so that's always a plus"", ""Went on a Saturday around noon- waited at least 30min to be seated, but worth the wait. Was given the option to try both gravy choices on The moneyball and was happy I did. They have different flavors but both so savory and the biscuit soaked up all the goodness. You should try the plain biscuit too- it practically melts in your mouth. Only recommendation here would be to implement a better waiting system. Maybe one of those vibrating buzzers so you don't have to wait along the sidewalk intrusively along seated diners, and also especially in the heat of the direct Sun."", ""For me this was a disappointing experience. Bad service, the four inside tables were not cleaned much (mine was never cleaned after the people before me), and it was way too cold inside on a wet March morning. My food took 30 minutes even though by the time it arrived I was the only customer inside the restaurant. I don't get the appeal of a restaurant like this.The tone of the sign on the door ordering customers to stay out if someone is inside ordering was a red flag. I appreciate the concern for safety in a time of pandemic, but there's no need to sound like you're ordering customers around before they even enter.And the hush puppies are not worth the calories. Like fried muffins.You may have a much better time. Maybe it's hit and miss."", ""We stopped here right before closing hours on a rainy day, and got 2 biscuits, one with apple butter and the other with honey butter. The biscuits were pretty unique; they were quite salty actually, but still had the tenderness and butteriness of a good biscuit. I liked the saltiness, but it's not for everybody; my friend found it overwhelming.I didn't like the apple butter that much. It was too tart and overpowering, and the butter part of it didn't balance the spread out well. The honey butter was classically sweet and creamy.This place gets a star knocked off for its service. Admittedly we were one of the last customers, but the cashier was quite rude, clearly annoyed and rushing us to hurry. He then told us to wait outside (it was 30 deg and slightly hailing) even though there still were people dining inside. They then forgot to give us any utensils, so we were desperately scooping the spreads with the biscuits themselves."", ""This place has been on my list for a few years now. It is so so so good. I would come back every here every time if I could. I would suggest you get the meat gravy on the side for any dishes without it. Our goal is to try each dish on the menu.

I know what you're thinking - Amanda, Portland is not in the south. This is true however apparently they do southern well. Quick fun fact: did you know the reason it's impossible to get a southern style biscuit outside of the south is because other areas of the US don't have the same wheat and flour? \xa0That said, Pine Street did a phenomenal job of working with what they had. \xa0The Reggie was everything I needed: big, meaty, and covered in sausage gravy. I also got 2 scrambled eggs and an assortment of jellies and apple butter. Always do this. 12/10 will go back as soon as Alaska drops some cheap fares again.

Like seriously where has this place been all my life?!? The Reggie DeluxeThe biscuits are made fresh on site. The biscuit is huge, which gives it the perfect chicken to biscuit ratio; resulting in chicken and biscuit in every bite. Biscuit was light and fluffy, perfectly browned and butter taste. The sausage gravy was the perfect consistency, you could taste the brown butter sage. Chicken was fried perfectly and well seasoned. I loved the house made hot sauce, not sure of that came with this one or the biscuit sandwich my friend ordered. Good heat that wasn't overpowering and fresh. I loved that the carryout container was filled with the perfect amount of gravy. No dry biscuit bites here. \xa0Yassss!! Finger licking is a must when enjoying this master piece. Pop Tart - Figgy PuddingThese are also made on site and fresh. Figgy pudding was the seasonal flavor. The presentation was excellent. Dipped in frosting with crumbles on top. Crisp edges from the egg wash and a flaky soft pop tart. The figgy pudding filling was phenomenal!!! I appreciated that the pop tart was not overly sugary. Excellent flavor palate, well done. Collard GreensGreens were nice and tender. Chef cleaned them well. Good vinegar base that was not overpowering. Very impressed to find southern style collards out on the left coast. COVID PracticesAll the staff were wearing masks and following the \xa0usual protocols. Today when I went they were short staffed and closed indoor dining. Not of concern to me, just saying this so folks who it is can call ahead to find out the status of they want to sit inside. They offered outdoor seating.

If you have already been, then go again we have got to make sure this places is around for years to come. #CynBites #ThisFeedsMySoul"", 'We knew we were expecting a long wait but I didn\'t really understand why there was one. We came on a Friday morning and only had about 8 people in front of us (about 4 parties). It took 45 minutes to even get to the front to order and still waited some time to get our food and eat. At first, I thought we were waiting to be seated or waiting for the restaurant to be lower than their maximum capacity but you seat yourself and was quite empty inside. You order at the front so I was confused on why the line took so long to just order. I understand if a restaurant is short-staffed but that did not seem to be the case.The staff didn\'t have the greatest customer service. One employee was actually quite rude and questioned why I was sitting at the ""larger"" table. Understandable considering it was just me at first but she told me to move and didn\'t ask me if I was with a party. I was with a party of 6 and the rest of them were ordering right after me. I kindly informed her that my party was ordering and that I ordered for dining in and she just turned away. I\'m usually really nice to employees so was surprised about the service. For the food, it was average for the most part. The price isn\'t too bad (I\'m coming from California) but maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. I was looking at getting the Reggie Deluxe or the Chatfield but the staff recommended getting the BBQ Biscuit. I wish the BBQ sauce was more potent as you can barely taste it and the house slaw didn\'t provide much flavor. It was very average. I definitely should have gone with my gut with the Reggie Deluxe or the Chatfield. My friends\' food were quite tasty for the most part. The hashbrowns were oddly sweet and wondered if they cooked it with syrup but was nice and crispy. Their homemade jam is quite nice as well. My friend had ordered a hot chocalate but it was mainly milk with a splash of chocolate. The 3 stars were mainly for the wait and the service. I would have given a 3.5 or 4 stars considering my friends\' food was better than mine but it wasn\'t the best experience overall.', 'VEGAN REVIEW: sadly, very disappointing. We visited Pine State Biscuits after passing by many times and reading all of the great Yelp reviews. Both the menu and the reviews mention various vegan options, but unfortunately THERE ARE NO VEGAN OPTIONS HERE. The vegetarian biscuit is listed as having vegan sausage, but do not let this fool you. I asked if it could be made vegan by leaving off the cheese and the person taking our order quickly barked ""we don\'t have anything vegan"". He then changed his statement and said ""well, I guess the hash browns and collard greens are vegan"". At the same time, another employee overheard our conversation and jumped in to say even though the hash browns were listed as being vegan, they were only made vegan by special request. As someone who is vegan with food intolerances, this type of misinformation is extremely disappointing. While I don\'t expect every restaurant to have vegan options, I trust that items listed as vegan are truly so. I will say that non-vegans in my group thoroughly enjoyed their food, but if you are vegan, find yourself another option.', ""Long story short: great food, but long wait and mediocre service.-The KFC (Korean fried chicken) sandwich was delicious! Biscuits were crispy but not too buttery & overpowering, but the chicken was SUPER crunchy, juicy, and had the perfect seasoning and sauce! I loved their pickled veggies they added and overall it was a super good sandwich. Would order again.- Reggie & Reggie Deluxe: Only difference between these 2 items are that it comes with an egg! It was alright. The biscuit again was crispy & it came with 2 options of gravy: bacon or mushroom, but we opted for a mix of both. Service was very im personable, cold, and super slow. We waited almost 30 minutes for food and no one else was there. They were super strict about having us do outdoor seating but several minutes later a party sat indoors. Wouldn't come for the people again, but the food is good enough to-go.""]",positive
"[""Review is purely for their happy hour oysters and fancy cocktails.Happy hour is 2:30 to 5:30 according to their website. My friend and I dropped by right at 2:30 on a Monday afternoon and was seated in the outdoor patio. It's very well heated so we didn't have to worry about the cold at all.I had seen their nice cocktails on Instagram and knew what I wanted to try in terms of drinks. First was the Empress Martini ($18), which was very smooth and nice too sweet. It was very easy to drink this, plus I appreciated how they serve it with a bubble so you can get a cool video. It did feel a tad bit gimmicky, as the bubble was purely for the aesthetics and I don't think it had much influence on the flavor of the drink.Next up was the Melon Ball ($18), which is served with cotton candy on top. I was a little bit disappointed by this drink. I was hoping to push the cotton candy into the drink to give it some sweetness, but the drink was plenty sweet already by itself. We ended up taking the cotton candy off and putting it on a side plate to eat separately. This made it feel very gimmicky.We had a large brunch before coming here so neither of us were hungry. We snacked on 1.5 dozen oysters ($1.75 each during hh). The oysters were hit or miss. Some were bigger and meatier but others were tiny. Still, they were a good value with the hh pricing!"", 'Okay, I am not mean.... but my daughter reserved the place on my birthday. So, we dined with my family. The service is bad. I was disappointed. Sorry, I was honest here. We ordered to start with calamari. They gave it but NO plates \xa0nobody touch the calamari \u200d until the server notice and I have to ask the plates!!! Good thing, the calamari was good \xa0Then, we started ordered. The drinks were interesting, specially the glowbal ( bubble thing ) drink. \xa0The food were not special on their price. I forgot if somebody checked out. Usually, the server checked out like ,"" how\'s the food? You need more drink? You want to see the dessert menu."" Lacking human connection. Oh! The server asked if she wanted have bag for leftover. We started to leave.... Nobody said,"" thank you."" Or smiled to us.... Nada \xa0I\'m not recommended this restaurant. Sorry.', ""TLDR: Don't dine here, worst service by far at any restaurant downtown, Vancouver.  Our server neglected our table, our whole section really. She barely spoke to us, did not try to get to know us, and did not make us feel welcomed. We ordered our drinks, she did not give us recommendations though we indicated that it was our first time. Our appetizer came before our cocktails, which lacked flavour. I was not satisfied with my drink and was never given the chance to switch it out for something else. She made it feel very straight to the point and was quick to leave our table everytime we stopped her. My dinner was cold but our waitress never came to check how everything came out and how our first few bites were. By the time she came around we were finished and by that time we just wanted to get out of there. It was very obvious that I did not touch my drink, or my dinner. Only after I paid with her looking over my shoulder to see what percentage of tip I would give did she ask how our meals were and if everything was alright. If I did not leave a generous tip, I doubt she would have bothered to ask. After I was finished paying she stated that she wishes I would have told her sooner about my drink and she would have taken it off my bill.... Funny how it was after I paid and added a generous tip. Will not be back, very disappointed as it was our first time there and I have nothing good to say about my whole experience."", 'It\'s been awhile since my last visit at Glowbal... I still remember those $10 brunch benedicts with $5 custom Caesars and complimentary mini donuts. We saw they offered two ""Big cut Thursdays"" specials, one of which is a 54 oz tomahawk steak with seasonal sides, for $139. Seemed reasonable, so we thought we\'d check it out.It was a rainy and chillier night, and they had seated most of their tables in their covered and heated patio. It is definitely heated enough to be comfortable without a jacket, and it is a beautiful space.Served sliced on its own plate with the sauce, the steak was cooked medium rare like we wanted. However, the presentation was a bit underwhelming as they placed the bone separately from the steak. We also felt like for 54 oz before cooking, the bone must have weighed a huge percentage of it, because we didn\'t get nearly as much steak as we expected. For the size of the bone, and from looking at where the meat was attached, it seemed like they might have missed a few slices? Who knows. The steak was pretty good, and the sauce complimented it well.For sides that came with the tomahawk steak, we got mashed potatoes with roasted vegetables, cauliflower gratin, and macaroni in tomato sauce. The cauliflower gratin was great - super cheesy and saucy. Unfortunately the roasted vegetables were nearly raw, especially the carrots - these were all super crunchy, as if they\'d hardly been cooked. And the macaroni quality was on par with say, a buffet or make-at-home with jarred sauce.Service was slightly below average. At first we were seen pretty quickly, but afterwards it was difficult to get extra utensils (for sharing), the bill, etc. Also, our waiter\'s face mask revealed his nose half the time, and he barely bothered to adjust it, which made me slightly uncomfortable as we were well within 6 ft of each other.They no longer take reservations on OpenTable, unfortunately. That was a big plus for me, personally. Oh well. Now they use another online system (linked via their website) with no points collecting capabilities.Over the years, the prices at Glowbal seems to be going up while quality has been downhill. All the other restaurants in the Glowbal chain are better. I don\'t see myself returning unless they make some drastic changes with promotions.', ""My friend and I started doing monthly cocktail nights and we both had our eye on this place because of the spectacular drink menu! The cocktails under the executive section are a splurge, but definitely worth it. I tried the empress martini, which was light and sweet (but not overbearingly so). That drink was topped with a smoke bubble, which was super fun to pop!My friend got the illusionist: champagne poured over an aperol, chamomile, and honey ice sphere. Super pretty!As for the food, I found it pretty affordable considering we were downtown. We split a couple dishes, plus dessert, and that was filling enough for both of us. Here's what we ordered:1) Wagyu steak tartare - this was my favourite. The ciabatta bread was perfectly sliced and toasted. It's a small detail, but it matters. Too thick or charred and the bread would've competed with rather than complimented the beef. The dots of smoked egg yolk gel on top of the tartare were awesome too.2) Wild mushroom risotto - my dad makes this at home, so I was instantly drawn to the dish. Glowbal elevates this comfort food classic with enoki fritters, which I wish they included more of! 3) Cheesecake - my friend and I couldn't decide what to get for dessert, so we went with what our server recommend. We're so glad we listened to him because this cheesecake was heavenly! Rich, tangy, and sooooo creamy. I loved it!I definitely want to come back for more. Thanks Glowbal for the great time!"", 'TLDR: Extremely underwhelming food considering the upscale pricing, with very few good things to say about the restaurant as a whole. Would not recommend or come back.My sister and I decided to give this place a shot after seeing it highly recommended on trip advisor. We started off with a couple of their specialty executive cocktails and brioche bread starter. The drinks were really fun and theatrical (do it for the $19 gram I guess), and the buttery soft brioche was the only highlight of the meal. Now onto the disappointing appetizers and entrees, beginning with the wagyu steak tatare appetizer. The umami flavor of the wagyu was overpowered by the intensely vinegary mustard, wayyy overly acidic. For entrees, I ordered the crispy half chicken which was mediocre at best. It had a nice crispy skin, but the meat itself was over cooked (the white meat portion was especially dry). The side cabbage and duck slaw tasted like it was doused in sweet baby rays barbecue sauce and not it a good way. Didn\'t finish this dish. But truly, the coup de grace was the Lamb Ragu entree my sister ordered. It was absurdly salty to the point of being inedible unless she chugged water between each bite. She sent it back after our server offered to get her a new one. The remade dish was equally salty and she ended up SENDING IT BACK AGAIN after a few bites (she\'s someone who NEVER sends back food too).

Let me tell you what to expect here because I did not know. If you are expecting a clean meal where you eat with utensils off of a plate of food, this is not your place.

The ordering is a little confusing but between the three of us we got the Three item combo, which gave us extra mussels. We threw in corn and potatoes and had garlic noodles on the side. Little did I know the Louisiana sauce would have more garlic than the garlic noodles.You put on the bib. I wear the plastic gloves because I am unauthentic (and because I don't want my nails to smell like garlic for the rest of my life). You open the plastic bag and start choosing what you want to eat. We picked snow crabs, mussels, shrimp with the head on because apparently it's a thing to suck on the heads.

Thanks for having my back Loui Loui!! We ordered the Seafood Combo A (2 seafood, 1 side) with shrimp and crawfish in medium Louisiana sauce with a side of garlic noodles, along with potatoes for an extra cost. All I can say is: AMAZING. The seafood is fresh and the medium sauce( though a bit spicier than I expected) really adds an extra kick.

It consisted of bite-sized, deep fried shrimp with lettuce, onion, and tomato. The finishing touch? A zesty sauce drizzle. It came with a side of Cajun fries (you can also opt for regular fries, too). I enjoyed this meal so much!!! The shrimp additions were super flavorful and not too crispy. The vegetable add-ons tasted fresh and the plentiful sauce was a great touch. It definitely added an oomph to each bite. The Cajun fries were out-of-this world good! There was a perfect amount of heat and spice to 'em and needed no ketchup or dips because you'd just mask the flavor. Everything was so filling!They also have sides, dessert, fried baskets, and seafood boils. I'd definitely stop by here again to try something else (or just get the shrimp po' boy again, tbh).

Despite only going medium heat for my friend's sake, I can say as someone who enjoys spicy foods, medium is hot hot hot! Cajun spice is no joke! I am so intrigued at how much spicier it can get. The two seafood combo comes with one side (3 comes with 2, 4 comes with 3). We got the garlic noodles and ordered corn as well - definitely my recommended sides of choice - don't pass on the garlic noodles! I'd also like to try the potatoes and sausage next time.

No matter what I do or how many times I brush my teeth, the garlic smell stuck with me until the next day, so if you are on a romantic date..beware!I definitely recommend getting the garlic noodles and sharing because the portion of noodles are huge! I got the noodles, corn, and shrimp in mild Louisiana sauce and there was no way I was able to finish all the food on my own.The reason for the -1 star is because it's really cold and windy when someone opens the door.

Even the brick wall has been updated!Also important to note, the combos have also changed from their previous. If you check their website it has their most updated combo deals. Something that's new since the last time we've been is that they now include potatoes and corn into the bags! Was refreshing to see since we would also just add corn to our order even though it always seemed like something that should have been included anyways.Despite the rebrand and coupe menu updates, it's still the same old Loui Loui.

No matter what mood I'm in, I'm always down to eat it so when my friend suggested to try this place near her apartment I was ecstatic! We ordered 1 pound of clams and 1 pound of shrimp, along with a side of garlic noodles and french fries. My friend and I both agreed that the clams were a little too chewy for our taste. I also noticed the shrimp size was inconsistent. Some were of decent size, but others were a lot smaller. I was a little disappointed since shrimp is always my go to when I get Cajun food. While I loved the french fries (couldn't stop eating them!), they were not hot when I bit into them. I was also disappointed by the garlic noodles since they were all clumped together, so it made it difficult to get the noodles.I was pleasantly surprised that the clams and mussels were cheaper than the shrimp! In New York, the last Cajun restaurant I went to had shrimp as the cheapest. I also liked how the menu stated how many clams and shrimp comes in a pound so you know how much to order.Finally, the staff is really great. Super friendly and helpful.

The layout of the restaurant is cool. TVs surround the whole restaurant. It definitely contributed to my Celtics playoffs Fix when I visited. The seafood here is great. By far my favorite sauce that I've tried for Cajun food. Our party all shared the Louisiana hot sauce. Crab legs, shrimp, Cajun fries and garlic noodles were on point.

This is the second time coming here after a year And not one thing is bad Yes, They have the BEST Steaks.. skirt steak was cooked perfectly medium rare last time and perfectly marinated and seasoned.. juicy.. extra tender make your mouth wanting more for days.. This time, we shared the Best Cowboy Steak for two.. better than any Tomahawk Tuesday for two or any.. steak for two, as the meat melts in your mouth.. all 46 ounces of it.. perfect aggressive seasoning; don\'t need any additional salt nor pepper.. Perfect between medium rare and medium, as the Chef recommended the temperature for us to have Speaking of the Chef, he\'s the Best Chef in terms of the service he provides. Of course you will have to sit at the grill seats in order to be by him and the other chef next him did an incredible job of continously cooking steaksThe Best Empanadas just like last time.. premium ground beef and perfect crunchy crust that don\'t need any sauce at all The Best Spicy Tripe dish.. as you don\'t even taste the chewyness of the tripe that comes with homemade light and airy, freshly made potato chips that are perfect for dipping on that dish Good drinks and cocktails too.. as I noticed they have egg whites in their cocktails and ordered my favorite, ""New York Sour"" and it was one of the Best I\'ve had Yes, this place is hard to get in.. you have to get on the list a month ahead of time.. so make those reservations! Prices are just right for a high end place that is worth every hungry penny Other beautiful highlights: Nice, romantic ambiance Easy, calm music Clean restroom On-site parking or street parking options It is ab-solutely worth it BEST']",positive
"[""While having a family shopping day in the area, my parents wanted to stop and have an afternoon tea/snack at a HK Style Café somewhere along Richmond's Alexandra road. A random search for nearby places on my phone, and this place popped up in my search results.From the outside, the place is quite assuming. I was pleasantly surprised upon entering the restaurant; it looked like the place had recently undergone some renovations. Neat, clean, with all the expected COVID-related protocols and safeguards in place, and yes, they check your vaccine passport and ID cards quite closely).Since the timing was right, my parents and I shared a couple of mini-sets. These are always one of my favourite types of orders at any HK style café, a big reason being that a hot drink (coffee/tea) is usually included. We decided to share the staple Stir Fried Beef with Flat Noodles, and the Baked Basa Filet and Spinach on Rice in Cream Sauce. A slight hiccup when we tried to order local style coffees with our mini-sets, only to be told they only have HK style coffees. Oops! But the quick thinking waitress offered to serve us the coffee black, with the condensed milk served on the side. Turned out very well!My parents and I were quite happy with how the food turned out. Both dishes came out piping hot, a warm welcome on a nippy day like today. The Stir Fried Beef with Flat Noodles had just the right amount of oil (and was not dripping in grease). The Baked Basa & Spinach was coated with sauce that was creamy and not too salty, sitting on top of a bed of rice that had just the right amount of texture for me (not mushy but not overly hard). Summary of my impressions: a great salt-of-the-earth HK style café if you are looking for delicious dishes, and more than reasonable prices."", ""Food: Baked tomato & cream sauce on rice $13.50 - tastes pretty good and portions are decent for their late night mini sets. This also includes a drink and I got the honey lemon water although the extra charge is $1.25. Service: Went with a party of 13 at 9:30pm, reservations were made in advance however when we got there the table wasnt ready yet. It took 30 mins to get our order down cause there's only 2-3 servers and the restaurant was packed...luckily the food and drinks came quickly.Cleanliness: They use plastic dividers that they can roll around so then they can make adjustments for larger parties. QR code wasnt thoroughly checked probably because we were a larger party.Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back again since the food isn't bad even though the service was non existent (as expected for a HK cafe) It's a decent late night spot in richmond since they close at 1:30am."", ""If you're looking at getting some real hk feel good, this is the place. The atmosphere is totally hk style and even the service is. (If you know, you know) Environment: very good covid protocols are in place and they even divided the place out so that people only have one way to go to the washroom. It isnt super dirty but it's clean enough to sit for the meal.Service: same as hk style . Very rushed. And it takes so long to get their attention sometimes. Food: great! I had their congee with fermented egg and pork slices and baked pork chop rice! I would say that the congee is msg/salty and am in need of water. The baked pork chop rice is pretty darn good and would recommend trying it!"", ""=== 1. VERDICT/VALUEPrices have gone up over the years, but it's still a hidden gem of a HK-style cafe in Richmond. \xa0Not glamorous from the outside, but slight renovations on the inside and good food make Silver Tower a good choice for good eats!=== 2. FOODThis review is based on recent takeout orders...drinks of your choice are $0.75 for the first drink and $1 for each subsequent drink.Ham & Mushroom Fried Instant Noodle ($17): simple, yet delicious! The mushrooms, red peppers, bean sprouts help too :)Mixed Mushrooms with Seasonal Vegetables ($16.95): the veg is bok choy sprouts at the moment and when it's all cooked with a little oyster sauce, it tastes pretty good with the included serving of rice!Chinese Mushroom with Seasonal Vegetables ($17): similar to the above dish, minus the sliced canned mushrooms :)Shrimp & Scallops with Broccoli ($18.95): a healthy portion of good-sized shrimp and scallops highlight this dish - but those who tend to avoid ginger may want to ask them to hold back on the shaved ginger spread throughout!Deep Fried Pork Chop with Rock Salt ($17.25): tender, as spicy as you would like to make it, and perhaps one of the better offerings of such in town!Stewed Wild Mushroom with Yee Mein ($17): it felt a little short on mushrooms, but the best part is that the noodles were not as oily as offerings from some other joints in town! \xa0Still a solid choice.=== 3. SERVICEBased purely on three takeout orders, the service has been decent as expected from phone order to pickup. \xa0As usual, English, Cantonese, and Mandarin work well here.=== 4. ENVIRONMENTThe layout of the restaurant has remained the same, with COVID impacting which tables could be used for dining in. \xa0A bit of a renovation in recent years seems to have lightened up the place and in this reviewer's eyes, would make dining in more appealing. \xa0Wheelchairs and strollers would still work here, best engaged at the tables in the middle or in the front of the restaurant. \xa0Parking is always dicey in the complex's lot; however, going earlier in the evening (say, before 6:00 pm) tends to reveal better results."", ""I ordered the minute steak and korean ribs combo and what I can say is that I'm quite disappointed, I wasn't asked what the rarity of the steak will be so I just assumed that it's going to be medium and of course I wasn't expecting any blood for the korean beef ribs at all. But what I got was a steak close to being raw (just seared outside or on one side) and a korean beef rib that is medium rare. Not recommended for people who hates blood."", ""Came here for dinner on a Tuesday evening with a friend. Upon entry, there was access to hand sanitizer and a form to leave our contact info. The restaurant was fairly empty with only 3 tables. Strangely the server led us to a table directly next to a group of people. Thankfully Plexiglass surrounded our table. Menu items were decent. Most come with a drink. I ordered a Minute Steak with chicken wings with black pepper sauce & Spaghetti, While my friend ordered the Baked Spaghetti Bolognaise. The order came out in a decent time. Overcooked spaghetti dominated the plate. The steak was cooked decently but a bit small. Chicken wings were a nice golden brown. We both found black pepper sauce I found was wayyy too salty and spicy. My friend Spaghetti was better well done. Nice amount of cheese and meat. A bit too oily for my liking but he didn't mind. The service here is average. Some servers are better than others. It took a while after seating before someone took our order. In my option, if you're looking for HK Style food, there are much better options around this price range. However, if you're looking for something that has ok food and is open late this may be your answer."", ""Came back and ordered D4 baked pork chop on rice with tomato sauce. It tastes pretty bland but perhaps it's good not so much msg. I wouldn't get it again tho.My friend ordered Hawaiian fried rice J1, it tastes really good. The fried rice has good wok taste and a kick of spice."", 'Another no non-sense type of Hong Kong Style Cafe, Silver Tower has been in operation for years, and it has always been a good place to go late at night with their long operation hours.Here for a quick Afternoon Tea:1) Preserved Vegetable & Sliced Chicken in Vermicelli Soup $8.95 (3 stars)Very simple and straight forward noting fancy, just wanted some light soupy item to tie me over till dinner.2) Singapore Fried Vermicelli $10.50 (3 starts)Good job for keeping the vermicelli still el dente and not greasy!! Flavour is on the spot for this item! Both items came with drinks of your choice, we ordered Iced Lemon Tea.Overall, a reliable Cafe for you to take a break during your busy day!!*Mini Set Menu available: 11:00am - 5:30pm / 9:00pm to close', 'Been going here for years!! Always such good portion and the flavours are out of this world. Brisket curry. JUST GET IT.', ""Didn't have the best experience here as the servers were quite rude, felt as if they didn't want to serve us and kept forcing us to order more food. Gave it 3 stars because the food was actually good.The XO seafood udon was very yummy, a bit spicy and had good flavours. Loaded with a mix of seafood and the udon wasn't too soft, had a good bite to it.The lamb curry rice was my favourite, the lamb was so tender. Curry was not spicy but tasted pretty good, it came with potatoes, onions and other vegetables.Overall, good food but bad service.""]",negative
"[""Flavors all day every day...... \xa0very layback environment small but worth it..... can use a undated but where I'm from places like this is the best in town"", ""We had a wonderful experience at Thumbs Up Diner. We were given a 45min wait time, however we were seated within about 25mins. The food was seasoned well and cooked to perfection. I ordered the challah bread French toast and it was soft and flavorful. If you're a French fry lover, you have to get a side of their fries! Lol. My partner enjoyed the skillet potatoes and fried shrimp. Our friends loved their meals too -- seaside entree and fried chicken breast, grits, and home fries. Our server was wonderful -- very friendly and attentive!"", ""I have to give this place another try! I ordered the Ultimate Seaside Breakfast. It comes with friend catfish, small order of shrimp & grits, biscuit (or toast) and the salmon egg scramble. The catfish was good! The first few bites of the scramble was good but I want a fan of the salmon & cream inside the eggs.. which was surprising because I love salmon! It was a bit much for me. The biscuit is more like an English muffin, it was seven. The shrimp & grits were also okay. I liked the herb seasonings they add to the shrimp & grits. It's a small local spot that plays good R&B music! I give this restaurant 3 starts because I like the vibe & the food wasn't terrible. My family seemed to enjoy their meals so that makes me want to go & try something else when I'm in town again. Ordered the Turkey bacon & pancakes for my daughter. She devoured the bacon lol. They have the good Turkey bacon.. not the basic Oscar Mayer Turkey bacon. If you're a true Turkey bacon eater then you know what I mean!Our waitress was a sweetie. We waited about 45 minutes for party of 4 adults and a child which isn't bad. There's limited space to wait inside so we waited in the car. The only con about waiting in the car is having to go back and check your spot on the line. They don't have a system where they can call/text when your table is ready."", ""Let's just get it out there - the things that keep this location of Thumbs Up from a five star rating \xa0- it's noisy. The coffee creamer is in those to go tubs. The place is not venting well so you can feel like you are sitting in the kitchen. Especially if something burns or a plate drops. And the bathrooms could use better lighting and a coat of paint. It's awkward watching people watch you eat wishing you could finish so they can sit down. Since the pandemic- I've had to spend more time in charming East Point. I love this little town and Thumps Up fits right in. The wait staff is personable and always gets my order right. The size and style of the restaurant fits in the area well. The menu is extensive so everyone can find multiple things to eat. They always have a special. The food comes out rather quickly. This place \xa0has a nice diner charm. \xa0The portions are generous and you always leave with a togo bag. Try the omelets, the potatoes, the biscuits, the pancakes. Try the Lisa : Steak and cheese eggs."", ""The two stars are for the great food. \xa0The service and response are the worst I have seen. \xa0The waitlist is problematic with is use and no staff to assist. \xa0Not Covid related as this was the system prior. \xa0Times of operation have not been updated on media platforms. \xa0You can't call to verify when they are open/ closed or even place a to go order...because they don't answer the phone. \xa0During hours they either done pick up or the pick up and hang up with bo response. \xa0How difficult is it to have a vm tell customers the hours and that you are not taking over the phone order (just like WH did)??? Should I be surprise from a cash only business. \xa0Again, good food...but the experience to obtain said food is wanting."", ""Had a small wait we sat at the bar it's our second time coming to this diner super down home feel and close to the Atlanta airport like 5-7 min away ,, good coffee nice size cup ,,, cash only establishment and pay for parking unless after business hours you can work at the bank"", ""Holiday Monday & there was a bit of a wait but it was worth it!! We sat at the counter & our server (didn't catch his name) was AWESOME!!! The vibe in this place was cool. The music was good & so was the service.The star of the show was the food, of course. I had the fried catfish as an appetizer.

Treat yourself."", ""I've had far better burgers, but this wasn't bad. The staff was friendly. The place was fairly busy. It needed some cleaning. The bottles were gross and sticky."", 'there needs to be give and take with a cash only business that really doesnt cater to customer service, but banks you coming back for good food. being short changed and coming back to wait til the front hostess finish the kiki with frans to get my money straightened and then not answering the phone as a take out restaurant during business hours. be grateful atlantans will still support business while taking crappy service. systems need to change because people want to support and see you win.', ""They are lacking one star simply because they need to organize their waiting list better. Honestly we waited over an hour for a 4 top. I was ready to walk away when I decided to go in and ask how many people were still ahead of us. Once seated our server was super friendly and engaging. She explained the menu and portion sizes. We were famished and were excited that it didn't take more than 15 mins to get our food delivered to our table. Everyone enjoyed their meals, and almost all of us had leftover to take home. The music was also great (90s hits). If you're going on the weekend, expect a long wait.

We lined up at 5pm right when they opened as we didn't have reservations. They couldn't have been more sweet and accommodating even with the popularity of their restaurant coupled with such a busy holiday. We ordered hot sake and miso soup to start. For dinner we had Soft Shell Crab roll, Spider Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, and smoked salmon. All were crazy delish. Impeccable service from our waitress and all for well under $100.

Overall we enjoyed our experience. We weren't in a rush. I'd go back!"", ""This is probably my second or third time visiting this restaurant. It is a place that many people in Columbus rave about when recommending a sushi place. And it is typically always packed. But I would say that it is not a vegetarian friendly place. They had a handful of vegetarian sushi options but apart from that majority of their entrée items were not vegetarian. Even if they did not actually contain meat some of the sauces they use contained clam or other animal products. So unfortunately it was very difficult for me to order. But our server was very helpful and went through several of the entrée options to help customize an order for me. I ended up going with a tempura vegetable fry, sushi and tofu. It had also been a while since I had sake so I went with an order of that as well. I greatly appreciated the service that I had in the restaurant and we received our food in a timely manner. But I do not plan to is it the restaurant in the future due to the lack of vegetarian items. Being an Asian restaurant a would assume they would have more options because I haven't had A problem in the past ordering at Asian restaurants. But I would say it's a great option for meat eaters"", ""We came here on a Sunday night and it was very busy! The host was friendly when seating us.

We got the akai Hana box which is served with soup or salad and mochi desert as well, the explosion roll it has shrimp on the inside with scallops and spicy Mayo on top, and the party boat for 2-3 people. The food was very good! I personally think it's a bit overpriced but definitely worth trying. The only stuff we didn't like was items we personally just tried and didn't enjoy; not how they were made.

My fiancé and I visited on a Monday night after she found photos of the restaurant's dishes on Instagram. We made a reservation through OpenTable and were seated immediately upon arrival. We ordered the Shrimp & Crab Dip, Calamari, and yeh Lobster Roll. Shrimp & Crab Dip:The dip was ok. There was nothing extremely memorable about it. It was slightly bland, it had about three pieces of random shrimp in it with some small pieces of crab. The pita chips were a nice accompaniment. A softer or fresher chip could have taken this dish up a few notches. Calamari:The calamari was fried entirely too hard. It wasn't fresh and tasted frozen. My fiancé ordered it as her meal and she didn't even finish it because she was completely dissatisfied with its taste and freshness. Lobster Roll:Saved the best for last! The lobster takes the cake. It's easily the very thing that gives this place three stars. The lobster was warm and fresh. The brioche bread was a bit hard and on the toastier side, which was quite surprising. It did not, however, affect the overall deliciousness of the lobster. - I ordered the kale slaw as a side. It's a citrus base slaw similar to coleslaw. Perhaps it was just my allotment, but there was a lot of cabbage and other veggies, and very little kale, which was the reason why I ordered the side. -------The service was decent. Our waitress provided some insight on what to order and helped us navigate some of their cocktail offerings. Neither of the two waitresses that I saw were wearing masks during our visit. Our two cocktails plus the dip, lobster roll, and calamari totaled about $93. Outside of the lobster roll, it wasn't really worth the money. Instagram pics can be quite misleading."", ""Ehh. This place seems awesome. The name is pretty cool as well-but it leaves must to be desired. I ordered a lobster sandwich. The sandwich was fried so hard I'm not quite sure there was lobster in it.

I particularly liked the niku udon - well-cooked noodles and juicy beef slices (unfortunately in an overly-salty broth). Other things to note were the kaarage chicken, which was well-cooked, tender, and came with a delicious side salad, and the katsu-don, which came with a healthy portion of tasty, juicy pork. The okonomiyaki was a bit disappointing unfortunately - it was quite bland and much too soggy to keep its classic pancake-y texture.

They don't take advance weekend reservations, only the day of, and we were able to get a reservation on a Saturday night. I would highly recommend a reservation as it's a small place and you might have to wait a while otherwise.Despite being a small place and quite busy, we did not feel rushed by the staff who were very friendly and well versed with the menu and able to explain things/ingredients to us.Definitely loved the place and the service and would be going back to try more items off the menu!"", ""I didn't have much time when I stopped by the bar for an okonomiyaki, but the vibes were great!""]",positive

We probably waited about 15 minutes to get to the cashier. I ended up getting the créme brûlée donut just to see what all the fuss was about. I guess the draw is the pipet of Cointreau stuck in it. It was cool to watch them glaze and then fire the donut. However the donut itself was way too sweet with its creme filling. I tried a little of the Cointreau with it but that made it even sweeter.

Both of these were very good. The Chicken and Biscuits contained mimosa brined chicken breast, sausage jalapeño gravy, housemade buttermilk biscuit, garlic chili honey. This was extremely delicious. The Chicken was fried perfectly and the chicken was juicy. Most of the flavor and seasoning was in the skin however. The French Toast was delicious the accompanying sweet tea caramel, fresh whipped cream, pistachio brittle, maple syrup was a perfect compliment to the french toast.

I usually always get the fried chicken and biscuits(+gravy) and it's top tier, the meat is juicy and flavorful, skin crispy and just wonderful. Another go-to, is the truffled deviled eggs with a sauce that will make you want more than just the 2.5 eggs that the order comes with! My most recent visit, I finally branched out, got the shrimp & grits, and was blown away. The dish was a bit spicy and had a nice Cajun taste with jumbo shrimp and the Cake balls are incredible and you can't really go wrong with any flavor that you pick.I may be biased but I really do think that the staff are rockstars because it is always completely booked when we go on Sundays and they handle it so well and it never decreases the quality of service."", ""I'm always intrigued as I walk past here at the domain so I finally gave it a try. I got the chameleon cold brew and the hot mess dessert. The cold brew is not fresh made but pour it yourself from a bottle experience. I was slightly disappointed that it was not made in house. Or rather I maybe not experienced enough to recognize that chameleon is from a bottle. Either way, the coffee did taste good. They only have whole milk or soy beverage options. The hot mess.... Is a hot mess. And a delicious one at that. It's not overly sweet and hits the sweet tooth if you are craving it. The hot mess includes molten chocolate brownie, with Mexican vanilla ice cream melting on top, sprinkled with toffee crumble and drizzled with chocolate ganache.

The first time I went, my party ordered an antipasto and were given two entire orders of it. The second time we went, we ended up waiting 20-25 min past our reservation time for our table to be ready. As a consolation, we were handed a calamari appetizer while we waited outside and then given some delicious shrimp to eat once we sat down. Both times we got tiramisu for dessert for free as well. As far as entrees go, I've tried the chicken carbonara and the seared chicken. I'm not the best judge of Italian food (I feel like Italian food from any less casual Italian place generally tastes pretty good), but I was a big fan of both. I would say another reason to come to Pomodoro is the ambiance. The restaurant doesn't really have its name anywhere in the front so it has a hole-in-the-wall feel. It has a cozy feel inside with only one waitress serving all 6-8 tables. I would love to come back here again on a special date night.Cons of Pomodoro are...1) It's cash only2) You'll have to make a reservation pretty early on if you want to eat on a weekend3) Service can be slow (it is a small place with only one waitress after all).

We got 2 baskets of bread rolls and made sure the broth didn't go to waste!I ordered Seafood Fra Diavolo and really enjoyed it.

It's a cozy (albeit a little small) space. Tables are very limited so reserve in advance. We knew about the free dessert at the end, but the waitress was so kind to provide us with a free calamari appetizer as well. We were blown away by this service! The calamari was crispy and well-seasoned, and the sauce that came with it was delicious. The bread was also very flavorful and we finished the whole basked with no problem.The pastas are all priced at $23. We got both the tiger shrimp w/ linguini and the tiger shrimp w/ salt cod. The linguini was with red sauce, which tasted ripe and fresh. The shrimp was well-seasoned and delicious. The salt cod was good, too. I thought the texture/quality of the pasta itself was just okay, but everything else was fantastic.The tiramisu at the end was delicious and a very nice finish to the meal.Our waitress was super friendly and responsive."", ""Pomodoro feels like a family member opened a restaurant to cook for their friends. The location is small, even for the North End, but feels cozy with a lot of candles and big windows. There are all kinds of tables - some high top, some standard and even a few bar seats by the kitchen. We made reservations a few weeks in advance and had no problem with our timing or being seated.We were seated at a high top table right next to the window, the stools had small fuzzy fabric pieces on them which I appreciated because they made it more comfortable to sit on and it felt cozier with the chilly weather outside. Their menu isn't expansive, but there's more than enough options for everyone to be satisfied. We tried the calamari appetizer and chicken carbonara pasta in addition to the bread and olive oil starter (sooo good) and the complimentary tiramisu for dessert. Service was quick, but we didn't feel rushed. All the courses were timed perfectly with just enough time to sip some wine in between dishes.Overall I had a great experience at Pomodoro - the only downside is the amount of planning that goes into a visit here. You need to make reservations well in advance and they only take cash. Neither of which will keep us away in the future, but unfortunately this is not a spot you can just pop into if you're craving it."", ""I LOVED Pomodoro; it provided me with two superlatives in one meal (the mussels and the tiramisu - both the best examples of their kind I'd ever had)!Just assuming they didn't take reservations (but apparently they do) I showed up and got very, very lucky with their last available table for two. This is a TINY place and I still can't believe my luck.I had come for their tiger shrimp and salt cod dish, which sounded unique and delicious - and it was, but I fell in love with the mussels first. A stupendous amount for $16, it seemed like one of those bottomless buckets of wings you get at an AYCE place, except in a rich, brilliant orange saffron fennel broth and with every. single. mussel! sweet and perfect. Not a bad one in the bunch, which is a feat when you're eating what feels like 50 mussels! Some were bigger (and with more of a taste of the sea) and some were smaller (with more of a sweet taste) but all were devoured enthusiastically.By the time we had finished with the mussels and the shrimp/cod dish, we were so stuffed that if I had known free tiramisu was coming, I would have declined it. And it would have been a huge mistake. I've never loved tiramisu - only ever ordered it for the creamy guilty pleasure of it - and this one looked too bready to even bother. But looks can be deceiving, and the lightly soaked ladyfingers had a wet yet not soggy texture and the strong overtone of good espresso. My friend, who just a minute earlier had been worried he was going to throw up from having totally overindulged, and who said I could eat his tiramisu, saw my face after I tried it and quickly changed his mind.""]",positive

I really wanted to add Kettle Chips with my Tartine, however that was not available. We got a side of fruit instead.My husband really enjoyed the sandwich. It had a very unique taste with the ham and dill cream cheese. It was a good size as well, very filling. The Tartine was presented beautifully but was a bit dry. They had several options and it was a tough choice, however I was thinking I should have gone with another one instead.Overall, there was nothing spectacular about our lunch but it was good. I think there are some other menu options that I should have considered. I would probably give this place another chance in the future.', 'This is such a lovely place! I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here. I ordered the Coq au Vin Blanc and the chicken nearly melted in my mouth. The presentation was beautifully done and the service was excellent. I also enjoyed the location of this restaurant it truly had that French style café feel. The only thing I recommend is that they lay brick or tile in the back because there was a lot of dust, so we sat in the front. \xa0I completely failed to take a picture of the blueberry blintzes that I ordered because they disappeared in five seconds they were that good!', 'This is the best place to eat be real fast or brunch in ATX!

I ordered their Cajun baked potato that comes with a drink and it did not disappoint. It had a generous amount of toppings, the shrimp were cooked to perfection, the fried chicken was crunchy, hints of smokiness from the sausage, the corn added slight sweetness, the cajun cream sauce is what truly elevated this dish adding an explosion of flavor but yet still balanced and it was all topped off on a buttery baked russet potato. Can't wait to try their other baked potatoes and wings. Rating: 10/10Cajun- Shrimp, fried chicken, andouille sausage. corn and cajun cream sauce loaded onto a baked russet potato."", ""This is hands down BEST baked potato I've ever had in my entire damn life.I am blown away at the portion size, the flavors, and the customer service.

We were also able to sample sauces to help us decide and they make it in house, honestly if I could bottle both to take home I would! My plus one and I shared both dishes and appreciated each for what the flavors presented. Something I always appreciate in a dish is when you can savor every bite without having to add anything to it like salt or hot sauce or etc. This place checks every seasoning and flavor box there is.

From first glance, it may seem expensive but once you get your order, you quickly realize you're basically served a grip of entrees on top of a massive potato. Break the thing down into its individual parts and it all makes sense. When we arrived they only had 5 potatoes left and they needed about a half hour to prepare (which they were very up front about) so we ordered and then walked to a nearby place (Rosewood) to grab a cocktail while we waited - supporting two businesses in one outing? Never a bad thing.I customized mine with fried chicken (it just says chicken on the menu, so be forewarned!), cajun sauce (which already has cheese in it so she advised me I didn't need additional cheese as a topping unless I really wanted it - much appreciated!) and asparagus. When we got back to collect our goodies, they mentioned they ran out of asparagus so got my permission real quick to add mixed veggies instead (didn't just assume that was ok, which was considerate). Picking up the bag requires muscles! That thing is no joke. When I finally consumed it, I was in starch heaven. That cajun sauce is perfection, the fried chicken was a nice texture change from the potato and the potato was a golden goose of a vessel. I loved it, as did my dog who went wild when he sneaked some while I wasn't looking.

I ordered/paid for a brisket baked potato and a fruit punch. I placed my order 20 minutes before I arrived at the food truck.

I received a receipt via email and a text with my order number/time to pick up my food. You can choose what time you want to pick up your food. The online system was easy to use. The food truck was easy to find as they are next to the George Carver Library. The parking lot is small, but you can park on the street. I went to the pick up order window and two men were present. One man was sitting down on his phone and the other man was working on orders. I stood at the window for at least a minute before I was greeted. The guy that was sitting down asked for my name and I told him. He told me they ran out of brisket and fruit punch. He advised the online system still allowed me to place my order even though they were out of brisket. He offered me a refund or told me I could order something else. I ordered the chicken fried baked potato. I asked for a water. I asked why didn't I receive a phone call or text/email that the brisket ran out. He said his assistant handles that. Whatever that means. I had to wait maybe 5 minutes for my food. They give you a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready. When my order was ready I went to the window and picked up my food. There were no silverware or napkins in my bag. The bag was heavy from the loaded baked potato. The food was good, but the customer service was not good.

"[""Love this place! I chose this a birthday gift. Great sushi, kobe beef, atmosphere, service. Can't wait to go back! Highly recommend."", 'I\'ve lived in the Boston area for years, and O Ya was always at the top of my ""must-try"" omakase list. I\'m glad I went and tried it before leaving Boston, but I probably wouldn\'t go back given how expensive it is. FOODA few of the dishes were incredible, a number were disappointing, and most were fine. The omakase is not a traditional one - it is very heavily influenced by Southeast Asian flavors (particularly, Vietnamese and Thai). This might be a matter of personal preference, but while I love Southeast Asian food generally, I didn\'t enjoy the extent to which it influenced the omakase. Some hit dishes of the night were:* Kumamoto oyster * Fried kumamoto oyster with squid ink bubbles - YUM* Bluefin chutoro* A5 Japanese Wagyu - GREAT* Mochi donuts for dessert - AMAZINGDRANKI had a glass of Chenin Blanc, and it was very, very good! VIBEI loved the vibe at O Ya - I think it\'s exactly what industrial chic should be. It strikes the right balance between upscale and cozy. The fact that there are only a few seats available (unsure if this is a COVID thing) adds to the intimate atmosphere.SERVICEProfessional and friendly. No complaints.MONEY THOAt $250/person (before tax and tip and drinks), it\'s just too expensive to be seriously worth it. I feel like O Ya is charging too much based on its historically excellent reputation (it\'s been around since 2007), and really hope that they improve their quality or decrease their price.', 'Disgustingly overpriced for sub-par ""sushi"" quality and underwhelming atmosphere. I had received a $500 gift card for the restaurant so I took my husband and we expected to have a filling meal. The hostess had a slight condescending tone, perhaps because we had a gift card? It\'s a mystery. We sat at the bar, and each sushi was served one piece at a time that the two of us shared, and I believe we had around a dozen pieces for the entire omakase meal plus one bottle of sake that was 5 times that retail price ($20 is retail price, I know because I buy that bottle sometimes) that totaled $500. We are both from Japan, from the coast, and we have had a ton of fresh, extraordinary sushi in our lives. \xa0The sushi at Oya was SMALL in size compared to some of the high end sushi restaurants I\'ve eaten at. \xa0Real high end restaurants in Japan actually serve you thicker pieces of fish, or ""neta"".So much overkill of ingredients in each sushi. Caviar that could have worked well on sushi but killed the taste of the fish underneath. Total fail. For the price, I did not expect to see chopstick holders that looked like they were designed by elementary school kids sold at a 100 yen shop. The sushi chef looked depressed and unhappy to be there. He wasn\'t talkative but he looked familiar to me so I asked him where I knew him from. Turns out he used to work at the old Ginza sushi restaurant in Brookline I used to work at years back. No offense but for these prices you\'d expect they hire chefs from more high end sushi restaurants. After spending the entire $500 and having to pay 20% tip on top of that we left frustrated, dissatisfied, and hungry. I don\'t know why this restaurant is still in business, maybe people just haven\'t had good quality sushi and assume the food is good here because it\'s expensive and served one tiny piece at a time? Do yourself a favor. Don\'t waste your money coming here, and don\'t support a restaurant that rips off customers with outrageous price for poor quality foods.', ""Definitely Americanized omakase. I think it's worth trying once but I was disappointed based on all the hype. The waiters are nice, albeit the only actual Asian/Japanese employee I saw was the main chef. The weirdest parts to me were that they did not give ginger, they included a fork and knife, and no one was eating the nigiri pieces with their fingers as traditionally done (as well as no finger wipe for doing so). As for the actual food, I thought that I wouldn't be full from the whole menu until the Wagyu came out. The first 15 courses came out quickly, one after another, but the last 5 had 15-20 min between each one, which made my friend and I very hungry. The standouts were the Hokkaido Sea Urchin, Wild Spot Prawn, Homemade Fingerling Potato Chip, A5 Wagyu, and Mochi Donut dessert. The worst by far was the second Foie Gras course with chocolate balsamic (definitely for non-Asian tastebuds), very strange/unbalanced in my opinion to follow up the fatty Wagyu with foie gras. In general, I felt a lot of the fish courses had too much sauce/accessorization and it would have been better if it was just the fish itself. I've had omakase in NYC for significantly cheaper that impressed and satisfied me far more. But I guess this is the best of what you can get from the Boston food scene."", 'Best meal I have had in Boston! No surprise there! We got the sake/wine pairing as well. Great service and explanations of the sake/wine. They are booked 2 months out so plan accordingly.

We knew we were in for a long night but with two little kids at home \xa0pushing our dinner up by almost an hour was frustrating. Manager never apologized or came over. Bathrooms were broken so we had to walk in the snow to a restaurant down the block- I know that was out of O ya's control, but it really felt like the sour cherry on top. We had to laugh. Most importantly- the food was subpar. We felt swindled. \xa0As others have mentioned, many of the dishes were overpowered by one ingredient- either a truffle or soy sauce or shallot.I expect high-end tasting portions to have a real balance of flavors. The fish was so thinly sliced it was hard to really taste it.

"[""If I could give 6 stars here I would. I was SO impressed with Broder Café.

They directed us to a tented area where we could sip complimentary hot coffee or tea while we waited. Once seated inside, I noticed the entire team works together like a well-oiled machine. Every team member doing multiple duties and each so incredibly friendly and warm. I also noticed the staff was doing a thorough job disinfecting used tables and washing their hands often. My husband smiled wide, having took note that there was an espresso machine next to a patch of beer taps. Two of our favorites things. I watched one of the staff casually ignite a coffee cocktail aflame, then sprinkle with spice and top with whipped cream. How fabulous. Food. Is. Incredible. I tried the danish pancakes which are actually orbs of pancakes, with just a hint of sweetness and lemon zest. They are served hot with lemon curd, lingonberry jam and maple syrup. My husband got the special of the day, a unique crepe dish with sausage, apples, havarti cheese, and a mustard sauce, with a perfect egg on top.

We started off with some drinks - my Ginger Spice Chai Latte hit the spot and my other friend's Turmeric Latte was good, but the Swedish Kaffe not so much. As for the entrees, we got the Aebleskiver (Danish pancakes with lemon curd and lingonberry jam), Pytt I Panna (Swedish hash with soft-baked eggs and pickled beets - we chose the house smoked trout for our protein option), Folorade Agg (lost eggs - eggs in a bed of creamed spinach topped with roasted mushrooms, under a parmesan/panko crust), and the Kottbullar (traditional Swedish meatballs sauteed in a sherry cream sauce and served with Nordic rye bread and lingonberry jam). It honestly sounds like a lot, but between the three of us, we demolished it all (maybe we were starving..). Our favorite dish by far was the Folorade Agg, but the Kottbullar was a close second.

They only have outdoor seating.We came at 12:30 on a Saturday, seated around 1:00, food came at 2:00. Husband ordered the hash with ham and roast beef, I ordered the salmon cakes and we got a side of the Danish pancakes. The pancakes were great, soft, moist, just sweet enough - the lemon butter and loganberry jams were fsbulous - 5/5. Salmon cakes were 3.5/5 but they were tiny for the price, about the size of your average dipping sauce dish. The hash had a lot of flavor but it was wet and tasted... healthy? Not sure how to describe it. My husband rated it a 3/5. Not to mention the toast - tasted great but it wasn\'t toasted, or warm, and it was tough (but maybe it\'s supposed to be?), and it came with no butter.They had a forced 20% gratuity even though you order before sitting and no one actually serves you, not to mention the have a cart out for you to clear your table after.

We even spotted our favorite MN hot sauce Cry Baby Craig's there.

One of the most popular items was the Aebleskiver, which were round, puffy, airy, griddled Danish ""pancakes"" dusted with powdered sugar and served with housemade lemon curd and lingonberry jam. The Shrimp Skagen Smorrebrod was an open-faced sandwich with shrimp salad (made of tiny shrimp), topped with a purple beet-pickled egg, butter lettuce, and mustard sauce on a slice of Scandinavian rugbrod bread, along with simply dressed greens and pickled beets, onions, and cucumber on the side. The shrimp salad was light and refreshing, and the rugbrod bread was one of the best versions of this Scandinavian bread that I\'ve had, as it was perfectly nutty and chewy without being too dense or dry. But my favorite dish (though not by far) was the Köttbular, or Swedish meatballs in a sherry cream sauce, served along with toast, house pickles, and lingonberry jam on the side. The best part about this dish was the lean, meaty meatballs along with the thick, decadent, savory sherry cream sauce, which added plenty of umami flavor. Overall, this was a great place for a cozy brunch with beautifully-plated dishes, spot-on execution, and great value too!']",positive

I heard the food and the atmosphere was great. I considered this for my husband\'s 41st birthday celebration. I will preface this to say, I have lived in Atlanta long enough\xa0to know how to brunch in the city, especially with large parties.Yesterday, I patronized this amazing restaurant but it was not without a tiny bit of drama. I called twice leading up to our visit both times to ensure an easy experience\xa0for both the establishment and our party.The second time I called I emphasized that I would be visiting with a large party (20 was the number\xa0I gave the lady that answered the phone). I asked another question related to our ability to bring a cake.The lady that answered the phone advised me to arrive at 9 am and that they could not push tables together, nor would we be able to actually sit together but we would be in the same vicinity. Which was fine with me. She also let me know what we could bring a cake and that we could also bring alcohol.When we arrived the wait staff arranged the area and we were seated, the gentleman, Barry I think was his name, took our orders and everything seemed to be going well. Shortly after, a lady (which I regret that I did not get her name but she had braids and she was an older lady) pulled me aside. She stated that for parties of ""this size"" (not saying what size that would be) she normally would charge for AND that there would be a 2 hour limit on our party. This made me slightly upset because again, I have dined enough in these Atlanta streets to know that large parties are problematic for restaurants but\xa0 I assumed that a call advising you all that we were coming would have alleviated any issues.Honestly, this ruined it for me. At that point, we were there, 25 of us, seating drinking, and waiting for our food to arrive. What was I supposed to do? It was completely inappropriate at that time to ""advise me"" of this policy.When I received my check, there was $150 booking fee on the tab which I immediately requested be removed. When I called in, this fee could have been made known to me.. but it was not. I had no problem paying the\xa018% gratuity as well as tipping extra but again, that $150 booking fee was inappropriate and illegal. I say this to say that we did not impede any perceived wait times, in fact, I think our visit helped amplify that small businesses are important in our community.We were all professional people that were dining, we were there celebrating my husband\'s birthday and we figured why not support a local business.Where I have a problem is that when I emailed Don to make him aware of my experience he made it seem like it was my fault and that he lost out on business. Also stated that at his BYOB establishment, we brought ""too many bottles.""

For anyone not familiar with a chef's salad, its usually greens with veggies and topped with strips of meat and cheese (typically ham and turkey and some sort of sliced cheese like provolone). I'm from the Northeast and our pizza places usually have the BEST chef's salads so I was excited to see this on the menu. I did notice is listed chicken and canadian bacon as the meats- weird but sure.Now, I refuse to accept that we live in a world where a SMALL salad should retail at $8 (and the large $13). But I was like hey, maybe their small is pretty heavy with lots of meats on it, and the large crazy big so I'll get the small.Salad arrives and nope, that sure is a small. More accurately, its side salad size. It does have chicken on it- and for some reason, the chicken is absolutely covered in some sort of really salty TACO seasoning! Like, what? Taste suspiciously like preseasoned, precooked chicken you buy in a grocery store. There was a hard boiled egg and some carrots, cabbage and a cucumber slice. But wait....where's this canadian bacon? Canadian bacon, which we all know is a thick cut of ham cut from the pork loin. Oh wait...after digging around in my little container I found that ONE TRIANGLE PIECE of COLD CUT HAM. In no way is that canadian bacon. And trust me I dug around....and that was the ONLY piece (see photo). On top of that, my archaeological dig into my tiny container unearthed an entire layer of brown lettuce at the bottom.There was some shredded mozzarella on top, and some unexpected avocado pieces (maybe that's why it's $8, we all know restaurants love a good avocado price inflation), and they gave you plenty of dressing. Like a ridiculous amount, two huge ramekins they rammed into the side salad container and if you used all that dressing for that side salad it would be like a cereal bowl of dressing with lettuce floating in it.A joke of salad which is a bummer."", ""I pass by this restaurant every time I go to HEB but I finally decided to check it out.

None of that decadent garlic bread thrill.* * *So why isn't this a two star review?The Lasagne.The actual stack of noodles and cheese that was the lasagne itself was standard issue.The noodle stack was the basic American lasagne you get in diners and at potlucks.What made this dish so much fun was there was way more in my dish than just the noodle stack.They put two large lasagne squares in a shallow metal oven dish and filled the dish with tomato sauce.They then piled generous masses of mozzarella cheese all over the oven dish from one end to the other.The whole mess goes under the broiler.This turned the lasagne into a giant pan of Italian queso.There was tomato sauce on the bottom, and noodle stacks in the middle for body.it was decadent.It was wonderful.It was my cheese thrill for the week.It was absolutely worth every calorie.* * *There is good stuff to be had here even with the various menu bombs lying around.Brick Oven is not that expensive.So you can fool around a bit, writing off some nights as losses.Come enough times and you will probably find the dishes you really like.Once you have your shortlist, the Brick Oven is a good place.*********Footnote for Cooks:Lasagna making in America has atrophied into completely boring cliches.Its always Italian Sausage or Hamburger, Tomato Sauce, Cottage Cheese or Ricotta, Basil or Oregano, Mozzarella or Mozzarella.Ever make a lasagna with tarragon instead of oregano?Ever sneak a layer of roast beef under the mozzarella?Ever use a white sauce rather than a tomato sauce, and blue cheese rather than mozzarella?We innovate with pizza. We innovate with nachos. We innovate with sandwiches.How come the only lasagna we make is the same one Fiorello La Guardia was eating in the 1930's?""]",negative

There's also plenty of parking out front.I walked in to find a slightly outdated space that was adorned with all kinds of plants. If you know me at all you know plants and greenery are my favorite. A smile quickly spread across my face. Almost immediately, what I would describe as a grandma figure that you automatically want to just hug, emerged to answer my questions and even make suggestions. She pointed out her favorite treat and I snagged one up along with a croissant and a conchas. The price tag was insanely cheap and just like that I was on my way.All in all, if you're looking for authentic Mexican treats, you've found your place.

The first I did my best to communicate was that I like spicy with flavor and when I said that they understood greatly. It even brought a smile to my server face. I then did my best to say. Give me whatever you eat that is spicy with flavor not just hot. I told him don't even tell me what it is. Just bring it out. I'll put some Tabasco pepper sauce on it and eat it. He smiled with a confused look and brought me tamales chicken tamales. Which was fine. I had them many times and they were good. He also bought me what kind of tastes like a Jamaican beef Patty but didn't have the spice as the Jamaican beef patty does. It actually had a little sweet taste to it which was fine. All in all I had fun. Just trying something different not being able to communicate thoroughly. Interesting my server that they would bring me something that was good and it was. Is this a place I would take a friend who's visiting from out of town? Yes if they can speak Spanish or if they were adventurous like myself. When I came the bakery portion of it was pretty low. I came about noonish on a Sunday. I don't know how they stock the bakery portion of it but I actually came for pastries. But when I walked in I saw all sorts of food being served.

"[""Somehow I've been to Ruby Chow's for dinner twice now before getting the chance to write a review!First and foremost. You need to come to Ruby Chow's for their modern Chinese/Asian food!ARRIVAL: Valet parking in the parking garage, at the end of the driveway behind the restaurant and validate before you leave. Both times we came here without a reservation, the first time we waited about 20 mins for a table and the second there was room at the bar, so we chose eat there which is still great.MENU: Most items are smaller plates for sharing. Baos should be ordered 1/person unless you're REALLY good at sharing. FOOD: We ordered the pork belly with grits, scallops, pow pow shrimp, roti, chicken chunk, shoyu tomago, katsu and duck baos. Favorites were definitely the pork belly and grits, shoyu tomago with crispy rice, and the baos. The scallops came out over-seared and near burnt so we didn't get them the second time. We also ordered double katsu bao on our return trip. The shoyu tomago is simple, but delicious with the crispy rice, you want more but i think sharing 1 between two people is enough because it's rich. the pork belly could be just a tick more tender both times, but the grits are creamy, rich and delicious. I will probably order this every single time.DRINKS: Soapberry; super tasty!!! Light and fresh.DESSERT: Mango sticky rice and pot de creme. Mango sticky rice is a big portion. The mochi was fresh and everything together wasn't overly sweet. It was a very tasty way to end the meal and I haven't had a mango sticky rice in a long time. The pot de creme was very rich and chocolatey, but dark. Sweeter than the mango sticky rice but not overly sweet. Would get the sticky rice again.SERVICE: Colton's service at the bar has always been fantastic. He's balancing drinks with food orders, chatting with the people at the bar, checking in on you if you're eating at the bar, and at times even running food. The man really cares about his craft and it shows. He has food and drink suggestions for everyone based on what you like! The servers have always been great and food comes out very quickly.EXPERIENCE: I have a great meal every time. The food is consistently good and it's super cozy inside though it can get loud at times.OVERALL: Excited to bring friends here to eat when visiting Atlanta! The food and drinks are great for a super reasonable price. It's holding a top spot on the list of last minute dinner options and i'm not mad about it."", ""Ruby Chows describes its style as Asian fusion style food. Having been in the mood for something different and new my parter and I decided to try this place out. We didn't have reservations but the restaurant was very accommodating and let us sit at the bar which also has full service. This may have been the best coincidence because the bartender we had was AMAZING! Since we didn't really know what we were getting ourselves into the bartender quickly came and explained the menu to us and explained that it was sort of like tapas \xa0where you are able to order multiple dishes and even recommended some options. We ended up choosing the Pecking Duck Buns, Mi Kho Char Siu, Pow Pow Shrimp, General Tsp's Chicken, and their Mango Sticky rice for dessert. Everything from start to finish was delicious! It was nice being able to try multiple different dishes at one restaurant which made it a an whole experience instead of just eating one main dish. The only negative was that if you want noodles they don't offer it as a side so you have to order one of their three noodle dishes. Overall, I loved the experience, friendly staff, and swanky atmosphere and will definitely be returning!"", ""First off- The outdoor seating area is great. It is very pretty with some art, fully covered and plenty of heaters. Our waitress was amazing and it was only her second day. Cocktails - we all enjoyed ours. I got the pineapple cinnamon one and it was so unique and good. I tried the cacio e Pepe pasta. It was good but not amazing. Didn't seem very flavorful with Asian flavors at all. I also got the tarp fried rolls and those were good. I wish there was a vegetarian bao option bedside my friends got the duck bao and that looked great."", ""Loved our dinner here last week! We came in on Wednesday around 6pm. They have validated valet parking which is $3 if you get it validated. We didn't make a reservation and were seated right away. The menu is kinda tapas style, but we actually each just ordered our own noodle dishes. I wanted the bao as well, but they said they were not serving it sadly. The drinks all looked amazing as well, but we just stuck with our entrees. I got the cacio e pepe with the pork cutlet. My friend got the pork kimchi noodles. Our food came out quickly! The cacio e pepe was too too good! So cheesy! And a large portion! I brought half home. My friend also loved her noodles! A super cool place!"", 'AMAZING!! Everything was good here; food, service, drinks and vibe. They offer valet parking at $3 which is a great price, not sure if it changes after a certain time. You must have reservations.

I tried steamed buns for the first time which I liked. The food and drinks were good. Our service was ok. When we were finishing up, I tried to stack my dishes to help the waitress clear the table and she literally said ""oh you\'re just making my job harder. I\'ve been doing this for 6 years. I got it"".

We were only able to get a 9 pm reservation but I'm sure glad that we were able to try it!! The dishes here were so innovative and delicious in every bite.We started off with cocktails and I had the Zona Rosa. The inclusion of the Serrano peppers accented the mezcal in this drink wonderfully. It was delicious! Everyone in our group loved their drinks.We ordered a mix of different plates to share. Some highlights were: roti prata and the Cacio e Pepe. The roti prata dipping sauce was sooo creamy and rich and the prata itself was flavorful and pillowy soft. The Cacio e Pepe was what I was most excited to try. I loved the idea of using ramen noodles as the base of this dish, the cheese and pepper cling to the noodles perfectly, making this a fantastic, must-try dish.Can't wait for our next trip to ATL to try Ruby Chow's again!"", ""My has been talking about this place for months, so I booked a reservation just so that she would stop lol Parking is a little tricky so be mindful when you come because they have a 90 minute limit. It's the holiday season so they have all their decorations up, it clashed with the normal decor, but honestly if the food is doing what it needs to do, who cares about the decor. Service was great too, everyone was friendly and our server was very tentative.It's tapas style, but it fills you up. Can I also shout them out for each item coming out hot?! Like nothing came out cold and we didn't have to rush to eat. The tables are a little small so they stagger your order to make sure you have space to enjoy your meal.I ordered the Cacio E Pepe (one of my favorites of the night, Chicken Chunk, Roti Canai, Shoyu Tomago, Walnut Shrimp (another favorite). For drinks I got the soapberry and the Holly, Holly Rosemary (seasonal). To be honest you can't go wrong with anything that you order here, it's all packed with flavor. The only thing I didn't like as much was the Shoyu Tomago and that was only because that rice was really hard (but my sister told me that's how it's supposed to be). I really enjoyed dining her and would definitely recommend it."", ""This was a meal experience I won't forget. We tried at least 10 different small plates, and I eventually stopped asking what everything was and just eating it because it was all 10/10 amazing. The coconut corn soup was the BEST soup I've ever had. The bang shrimp was a hit as well, along with the General Tso's chicken. There was nothing I tried that I did not like. The cacio e Pepe was an unexpected menu item that we LOVED. The interior of the restaurant is luxurious and beautiful, with lots of photo opportunities if you're into that. This is a great spot for special occasions or a date night."", ""I love the vibes here and the food and drink are amazing. Service is great too. As for my drink, I ordered the Okinawa sunrise. It was pretty good and gave me a nice buzz. It wasn't too strong and wasn't too weak, just perfect. For food I ordered the Brussel sprouts, walnut shrimp, chicken chunk, and soft shell blt bao bun. My favorite was the walnut shrimp. The shrimp was big and cooked perfectly, not too hard and not too soft. The Brussel sprouts and soft shell crab blt were also tasty and enjoyable. The chicken chunk was my least favorite. I could've done without it. It didn't really taste like much to me. Our server was nice. She was on it and very helpful when we asked questions. At the end, we wanted a picture outside. They were pretty much closed at this time (we were the last table sitting outside) and he still volunteered to take group pictures of us and even got the good angles. *chef's kiss*""]",positive
"[""Been meaning to try since I started commuting past here every day, and so glad I finally did. Another authentic Chinese to add to my short list in the area.I was impressed by the speed with which they accommodated my take out order, and thrilled when I got home with the BEST spicy fish fillet I have had. (Also, well-packaged. Didn't spill a drop even though I transported it tied to the back of my bike.) Crispy chicken chunks and dry-cooked noodles were also delicious. Can't wait to go back and try some other dishes. (But will absolutely get the fish every time!)"", ""When I came here, I was so excited to try authentic Chinese street food. Instead, I was served food that belong on the street. It was the most disappointing $125 we have ever spent. The food was beyond salty. It was the kind of salty that even rice could not fix. If I knew I was going to be served that, I would rather have taken a sip out of the ocean for FREE. Despite the salt, my party did not want to waste the food, and so we ate on. I pray for their kidneys. It took me 3 cups of water to finish half of the food. Even still, my body was aching and dehydrated - Shell City might have been a better name for this place. The food left me feeling like Spongebob when he tried to bring back King Neptune's crown. WaTeR... wAtEr...Anyways, I do not recommend this place."", ""Streetfood Revolution is delicious. \xa0The best menu item I've tried is the spicy chicken cubes. \xa0During the pandemic, I call to order and pick it up -- I usually just order the chicken cubes and have it with some home-cooked vegetables and rice. \xa0Their dry pot is also very good. \xa0Everything is delightfully spicy and savory -- all the good flavors. \xa0The chili crab varies in quality since they have different types of crabs depending on the season. \xa0Streetfood Revolution is my go-to for Allston takeout food, matched only by BBQ chicken. \xa0I'm excited to dine in again as well eventually!"", ""Stupid food delivery in Chowbus. Never give the exact amount of ham. I've ordered takeouts for several years in this restaurant. More then ten times they did not sent the correct number of ham in Spicy Bowl.

Should be on The Roster and a part of every Szechuan foodies rotation of places... go!', ""I was really excited about this restaurant especially since it promised authentic Chinese food and they really delivered! I don't read Chinese and the menu didn't have photos so we were a little lost and had no idea where to start. The waiter was really patient with us and was able to describe pretty much everything on the menu.We ended up getting the SFR spicy bowl where you can add different types of meats and veggies for additional costs. We got beef, sprouts, and enoki (the stringy long mushrooms) which were all good choices, but I wish we had gotten more filling like another meat choice and potatoes since there was so much sauce. I usually can't handle spiciness, but this bowl was hot but not extremely spicy like the waiter described.We also got rice in soup and legend tofu which both had milder tastes but both smooth and delicious as well. Other people in the restaurant (we came Wednesday and there were a good amount of people there considering it had just opened early March) ordered the dry pots which range between $27-29 and they're huge! They could probably feed about 3-4 people or 2 people with enough for leftovers. It looked like a mixed of veggies and meats (they offered squid, chicken, and rib) so I'd really like to try that next time.The place itself has 2-3 sections but seats a good amount of people, maybe about 50. Really good location in Allston around many other restaurants too."", 'latest updated: Since my friend insisted on try this place, I gave this place a final chance. It can get even worse. This is a typical example of ""getting worse as time passes"". The stir-fried green beans we ordered contained 2/3 of grounded pork. While I was thinking why there were so much pork, I tasted it. Then it was self-evident. The pork had a fishy and sour taste. It is obvious that the pork has gone bad. The cook wanted to use them as soon as possible, so he added a lot! What a jerk restaurant! Time to shut this place down. It\'s health hazardous!Updated Review:My recent experience at this restaurant is to take an delivery order. The classic grilled fish really impressed me. I don\'t know if they only put the fish head and the tail in the dish or the fish body is smaller than my fist. Wen we got the classic grilled fish, you can only see fish head and fish tail. When I dig into a large piles of cilantro, lotus root and onions to try to find where is the fish body, we only find several scattered fish meat with thick skins. This dish costs you $35. They\'d better buy organic vegetables for that dish. I have tried several grilled fish dishes and this is the worst. It completely change my attitude to this place. If you want to have grilled fish or other authentic Szechuan food. I recommend Mala restaurant which is one block away from this restaurant. For take out orders, WOW Barbecue also serves nice grilled fish.Moreover, the stir-fried clams come with 30% empty shells. Prepare for your shell collection.The food quality of this restaurant enormously decreases.Old version:This restaurant is newly opened.Although they don\'t have many kinds of dishes, but their Szechuan food is really authentic. The spicy taste comes with a nicely greasy smell. The spicy ribs come with onions, green peppers, red peppers and Chinese ingredients. They really taste complex, but delicious. Maybe because this restaurant is new, the service is chaotic.', 'First thing, place is sorta dark inside. I see some recessed lighting that\'s not on, so I\'m not sure if its broken or just off. They give you a menu and piece of ordering paper with pencil. You just tick off the dish you want. There\'s no number reference on the tick sheet so was awkward to compare against the picture menu. FoodWave Potato (2/5) mandarin style french fries - wasn\'t a big fan of this dish. Pretty heavy on cumin spice and salty so was hard to really get what the uniqueness of this app was. I\'d skip this app if you were eating here first time as it wasn\'t very impressive. Pork bone pot soup (4/5) super spot on! loved the deep pork flavor of soup. The bones were thick and had some meat on it. Not much meat but enough to chew on. The best part was the bone marrow that you can just scoop out with chopsticks. Pretty flavorful in good. At $14 though, i thought it was expensive for the portion. Sticky rice (1/5) pretty greasy and didn\'t taste that good. It was pretty bland and the ""bread\' was essentially fried though. No flavor and was overall a disappointing dish. No worth it. Overall the pot soup was the only redeeming feature here.', ""Went here for a quick Sunday lunch with a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food - they've gone better since our last visit more than a year ago! Street Food Revolution is considered one of the more authentic Sichuan restaurant in Boston and around, one can easily tell by observing the customers eating here.The menu is fairly broad, ranging from the typical pick your own Mala Pot, sichuan-style skewers, and a number of appetizers and entreés. We opted for a spread from their menu: Fish Mala Pot, which we wished had less veggie but has good flavor, Chicken Cartilage (great seasoning!), Double Cooked Pork Belly, The Century Egg with Sesame Sauce, fried rice with pork floss on top, and stir fry napa cabbage. All dishes were appropriately portioned and very filling. It's best to come here with a group of friends so you have some stomach real estate and share a mala pot, accompanied with few adventurous appetizers! Is it the best Sichuan restaurant in the area? That is debatable. However, my friends & I were happy to see how much they've improved this past year. Will stop by again sometime!""]",negative

There is homemade ketchup & mustard that comes on the side if you want to add that. The entire table ordered the burger & fries, and we were all in agreement that it was delicious.

I don't typically go for burgers, but he always has to, especially when a place is known for their burgers. He thought it was pretty good, I personally thought it was overrated. People make a huge fuss over the burger at this restaurant, and I just didn't think it lived up to the hype. I took 3 bites of it. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not as amazing as people have made it out to be. I did love the fries and the ketchup though. I'm pretty sure the ketchup was housemade. It did not taste like Heinz. _ springer mountain chicken $24OKAY THIS. THIS is what dreams are made of and totally makes up for my thoughts on the burger. This is hands down the best chicken I've ever had in a restaurant (that wasn't fried). The chicken was flavored very well. The chicken was insanely juicy. Just. Absolutely delicious. The bf agreed mine was the better dish. I could eat this chicken every day. In fact, if I am ever given the choice for my last meal, H&F springer mountain chicken is my answer. You will not regret it. I got wine, he got the old-fashioned. The old-fashioned was not overly sweet. It was really good. A solid drink."", ""I came into Holeman & Finch with high expectations for their famous burger, but I was honestly a little letdown. The burger is a double patty with cheese, pickles, and onions. The burger was not bad, but definitely not great in my opinion. My first issue was when I realized that the burger didn't have lettuce and tomato on it, which I consider essential. When I requested lettuce and tomato from the server, he was really nice and brought me lettuce but told me the restaurant didn't have tomatoes because they aren't in season (haven't seen that stop every other restaurant serving burgers). My second issue was that I really couldn't taste any flavor from the cheese. Finally, I was disappointed by the ketchup. I'm not sure what type of ketchup they serve, but it definitely isn't standard and to me had an odd aftertaste. These are the reasons that the burger didn't live up to my expectations, but I should mention that the beef and bun were good quality. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger more than me, and I think this is because he likes meaty flavors, while I prefer a combination of flavors when I'm eating a burger. The saving aspect of the meal was the fries. They were amazing!! Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The overall ambiance of the restaurant was okay but felt a little cramped. The servers were courteous and quick with their service. I will not likely return since I didn't love the burger, but it might be worth trying if you're interested in developing own opinion about their famous burger."", ""Had a great birthday dinner here a few weeks ago. Service was spot on from the second we walked in--host, server, and bartender (shout out to Cameron) struck the perfect balance between knowledgeable/professional and casual/comedic for our group's vibe. Yes, the burger is incredible and always will be. But, we also enjoyed the meat and cheese plate to start and the pimento cheese. The bacon popcorn was fine but nothing I'd order again. The crunchy gentleman was also an unexpected favorite. One of my friends ordered the carbonara without pancetta and was given a heads up that it would be pretty flavorless. She appreciated the heads up and honesty, but as a vegetarian she didn't have a ton of options and decided to risk it. She was \xa0super impressed with the amount of flavor the pasta had even with that warning.I think the cocktail menu was really the star of the show. We could've sat around for hours sampling the cocktails, especially considering how entertaining the staff was. Will certainly be back!""]",positive

It's quite a small serving, so you'll definitely have room for some sides. I wouldn't come back here for the burger.The actual wings themselves were a rip off, barely any meat on them BUT I really loved the buffalo sauce so I guess there's the advantage.The fried sides are the best part of this place.

Service was amazing, food came out super fast, within 20 minutes or so. Let's get down to the food! I decided to go with the Black and Bleu Burger, added fries to side to complete the meal.

Wont count it to them as I think it was primarily a DoorDash issue.

Don't judge-- I usually eat my burger with a fork/knife when in public due to concerns with germs.

Well seasoned and marinated. We did take out so may not be the optimum when served piping hot. 17$ with tips for 6 wings, IMO, is a tad on the pricier side of town. I can understand Andy Ricker for milking his cow of celebritidom, white washing ethnic cultures' food. That is a part that do not sit well with me. However, you have to give it to him for honing his craft and understanding Thai street food and putting a spin on it. No biggie to those familiar with Thai, Vietnamese food. Doldrum interior and no dining customers. \xa0Is puzzling at lunch?!"", ""In my several trips to Portland, I must say, the best meal I've had thus far has come from Pok Pok Noi! This restaurant definitely lives up to the hype! This location isn't very large, so I can definitely see a wait as a possibility. We came in on a Sunday night and were lucky enough to sneak in right before a rush of customers came in. On to the food! First off, our bartender/server was super helpful in breaking down the menu, including all the daily specials and crowd favorites. Everything sounded good! Lol. After some thinking, we decided to split an order of Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings, and I ordered the papaya salad for my main course. Let me tell you, the wings are BOMB DOT COM! So tasty! They're such a collection of flavors! They're flat out some of the best wings I've ever had, and I not only recommended them, but I'd go as far as saying you'd be foolish to not order them, lol! The papaya salad was great as well! But the wings were so good that they slightly overshadowed the salad, lol. But not in a bad way. And I washed the meal down with a Leo beer, which was pretty refreshing. So I definitely recommend coming here, and I'll for sure come back the next time I'm in town!"", 'To preface this review, I will admit the wings are great. They reek of fish sauce, and coming from Asia this is a huge bonus for me. I know a lot of people are off-put by the smell and understandably so. They also taste amazing, and I personally advocate for the spicy version, as it offers an amazing balance of sweet, salty, and spicy; which is a perfect blend of flavors. Be prepared to get dirty as these wings will always be best eaten with hands and the sugary coat is bound to latch onto your fingers. This truly makes for a finger licking experience. The interior is also incredibly simple with one bar and a backdrop of Thailand. I think this is entirely appropriate for the food style that they want to provide. My one gripe is the cost. At about 16 dollars for half a dozen, they can get expensive quick. And I totally understand that the wings count as flats and drumstick, but I would still normally recommend at least a dozen per person unless you are getting another dish on the side. I would certainly come back for more if I felt the wings were more affordable', ""Made sure to make a stop here since I was in the area and heard so much about it.

It needs to be served with a side of white rice or something bland to even out your palate-Pretty pricey for inexpensive ingredients used in the dishes; might be better to come during happy hour -Seating can be limited inside, depending on busy hours or if it's too cold to sit outside-Parking lot is small, but street parking is also availableOverall, this place is too hyped for me. I don't think it's worth the price, and can have similar wings and dishes elsewhere that are comparable in taste and quality."", ""Hidden in a residential area Pok Pok Noi was absolutely empty when we arrived for happy hour.

I ordered their special and the most raved about dishes to try at this restaurant: Ike's fish sauce chicken wings. (I did a combo order where it came with the wings and papaya salad). My wings were ordered spicy. And depending on your tolerance to spice I thought the level was pretty good, meaning I still get the kick from the heat but it doesn't over power the other flavors.However I think food palate does play a huge part in whether you will like these wings or not. Personally for me the flavor of the fish sauce was too overpowering and left a very fishy, salty after taste. My friend however enjoyed it very much and wasn't bothered by the flavor.3. Papaya salad: very good. You get a good crunch factor from the papaya and peanuts and with a twist of their own they added green beans which I thought were unusual but a nice touch. I wasn't very fond of the chunk of cabbage on the side. Normally I've eaten papaya salad with a cabbage/lettuce leaf where you place the papaya salad inside and eat it like a wrap or everything is chopped up and tossed in the salad. The side cabbage was a no go for me. The salad also had a nice spice kick and sauce wasn't too much or too little4. Thai tea - basic, traditional Thai tea that I thought was good. Some restaurants can either make a good Thai tea or a meh Thai tea and this one I give a thumbs up"", ""This has become a regular stop for us when in Portland.

We also had biscuits and gravy which was good. Finally we tried the chicken and waffles which was really good. The chicken was a little sweeter than I like but it was still good. The chicken was cooked well and the waffles had great flavor. We waited almost an hour for our food so that was the only thing that I didn't like. I asked a waiter if he could check on my order and he said he didn't know how (kind of annoying) I asked another waitress and she was able to let me know how much longer. Was it worth the wait?

"[""Fuzzy's is absolutely wonderful and delicious. Their enchiladas & cilantro lime rice are to die for."", ""Ordered catering for the work crew this past Saturday via Uber eats. It took awhile- said it would be about and hour, and it was just over an hour. Anyhow- the food was awesome. But I gotta say- their packaging is horrendous. Who puts borracho beans in a regular styrofoam container and then wraps it in Saran Wrap? The juice from the beans was trapped between the Saran Wrap and the container. So of course when you unwrap it, the bean juice goes everywhere. The same mistake was made with their black beans. Styrofoam container wrapped in Saran Wrap. The styrofoam rice container was crushed and the black bean juice got all in there as well as all over the PAPER bag that everything was stored in. So of course the paper bag totally fell apart and there was bean juice all over me. How ridiculous. You'd think they would have plastic containers with lids for the beans and anything else that was juicy. See pics for the mess. Despite the packaging incident which resulted in me needing to wash my shoes, change my socks, Ted hose and scrub pants, the food was delicious. The work crew loved everything. The chicken enchiladas were fantastic. Way better than the beef enchiladas. The fajita meal was great. Came with lettuce, guac, cheese, sour cream. The amount of beans resulted in that being the only thing left. The borracho beans were the best. The refried beans and black beans are good but the borracho beans w the bacon and all that, stole the show. Would I order here again? Probably not for take out. I would eat there.

The cheese was definitely ladled on there from a can and the meat had to of come from the same place as any fast food taco joint orders it from.

Got our food but I ended up with incorrect protein on one of my three tacos, the ground beef taco tasted like dog food. Or maybe think ""taco johns"" ground beef- but less flavor. my sister ordered the chicken enchiladas and the chicken was mushy and tasted like bland tuna with some flour paste that was colored to look like cheese sauce on top. All in all the meal was disappointing. When the server/bartender came up and asked how everything was we were honest and said ""really average"" and explained. He said ""oh really"", shrugged, and walked away.

"[""Amaaazing. Don't think I've been to a better character dining ever. The characters are fun and gotta love it when they dance around. Due to the pandemic, you can't go near them so it's a bit heartbreaking seeing kids faces when the characters they so want to hug back away from them, but otherwise the character interaction was pretty good. Mickey and Donald specifically were great entertainers. Goofy and Daisy were a bit colder. I have no idea why Minnie wasn't there. It's the Fab-4, not Fab-5 here.The food was so awesome my husband said he would pay the high price even without the characters. It is not an absolute Must when we are at animal kingdom. The highlight of this meal for me was the BREAD SERVICE. They had a chip made with chickpeas, I believe. It was light and crispy and was perfect with the Dipping sauces. It was so good, we asked for more. The highlight for the boys was the large meat platter that comes with MOROCCAN SPICED BEEF, SPIT-ROASTED HERB CHICKEN, and BERBER MARINATED PORK. The HOUSE-MADE MAC & CHEESE was delicious but has to be eaten quickly. Once it gets cold the cheese isn't so soft. The BLACK EYED PEAS were meh but then again I don't like peas so don't take my word for it.  The CAPE MALAY GREEN CURRY SHRIMP was okay. Not enough sauce. The dessert was meh. Instagramable but not that tasty. The staff was great and they were receptive to our request to be moved because the original table they assigned to us was at the back corner, where we knew we would rarely see the characters. We ended up at a great spot to celebrate our birthday boys."", ""I wasn't expecting to like Tusker House as much as I thought I was. I believe this play used to be Buffet-style, but now with COVID, the restaurant has become family-style, meaning they bring all the plates to you. All the food they brought out was delicious, and due to the African theme, tasted a little bit different than typical American-styled food. Probably for the kids, they also brought out Mac and Cheese, which was creamy and I am always a sucker for. They also paraded the safari-themed Disney characters through the restaurant, so it was nice to have a little bit of entertainment during our dinner.Overall, it was delicious and entertaining, and I would highly recommend coming here if you can get a reservation. Worth the price, at least with Disney pricing standards."", 'So much fun for families with kids and the food was really good which helps dad swallow the price tag.

The characters danced around with music playing and entertained for 5-10 minutes each, which was way more than I expected. It was a lot of fun.

There were four of us for dinner. 1 vegan, 1 pescatarian, 2 omnivores. The two omnivores loved it, we loved it. The Buttery mushrooms ( made vegan for us) were sublime, the butternut hash, has crispy, crunchy and so lightly fried you couldn't taste the oil.

"[""As someone from the coast, I was a bit hesitant to get seafood from a land locked city, especially one bragging about their seafood. Lemme tell ya - the hype is justified because this place is AMAZING. In the cutest little nook of town, def worth going if you are in the area and only a 10 minute Uber from downtown. The atmosphere of this restuarant is incredible, with two totally different vibes upstairs vs downstairs (but both feeling very coastal, cool, chic, and homey). Our server was the KINDEST woman (I wish I remembered her name!). When asked for her favorites, she literally walked us through the entire menu. Normally I hate when they don't pick their favorites (I can read a menu), but she described every dish in such exquisite detail - you could tell she REALLY knew her stuff and was incredibly educated about the menu. We ended up with the asparagus salad, snapper ceviche, and lobster roll. The only disappointment was that we didn't get more food (but we were full, more so that everything sounded SO GOOD). The asparagus salad is a fresh take on a Cesar salad - so fresh, light, and crisp, with delicious fresh croutons. The ceviche was spot on and packed a punch of citrus and flavor, and came with delicious crisp chips. The lobster roll was the star of the show. Again, being from the northeast I doubted the abilities of a lobster roll in Atlanta to impress me, but it did. They do NOT skimp on the amount of meat, and it was piled high on a buttery toasted hamburger bun. The lobster was tossed with the PERFECT amount of aioli as a compliment to the dish rather than overpowering it. French fries were included as a side. I love French fries, and these did not disappoint - super crisp on outside, while soft on the inside, with the perfect seasoning. Even the obligatory French fry side was perfection!I wish I could've ordered more food, but this was the perfect amount to share between 2 people. If I come back to Atlanta, I will def make this a must stop! Highly highly recommend for a seafood fix and amazing atmosphere and vibes."", ""Perfect lunch or dinner spot! I REALLLLLY love how informative our server was. He was able to explain everything on the menu and what it meant and he may just have great marketing skills or he just be on his s#*t but either way after he was done I was ready to buy everything on the menu lol. But despite wanting everything on the menu we just purchased the baked oysters and salt and pepper calamari for starters and I must say they were both really good! This was my first time trying and oyster and I was extremely impressed. But I ended up ordering the lobster roll and it was pretty delicious. If you are EXTREMELY hungry I would definitely suggest ordering an appetizer with the lobster roll only because I was able to finish everything on my plate. This place is definitely a vibe and somewhere worth trying for sure! And just note, they do not validate tickets if you are parked in the deck but parking wasn't crazy expensive so that's a plus too!!!"", ""Listen.When I tell you that BeetleCat's Lobster Roll changed my life, I am not kidding. Best $38 I have ever spent. If you have $38, spend it on this.I've been to New England many times. My dad is from just outside of Boston. I lived on the water in South Florida for 2 years. Never in my LIFE have I had lobster as delicious, melt-in-your-mouth, somehow fresh?????? (we're so far inland!), as I have at BeetleCat. I'm not sure what was in the aioli dolloped on top or what the bun was dipped in before grilling, but it was my gateway drug to BeetleCat addiction.Should I ever find myself in a scenario where I need to choose a last meal, BeetleCat's Lobster Roll is *IT.*Thanks for coming to my TED Talk, now on to the rest of the review :)My little crew of three had the first reservation of the day on Sunday for brunch. The interior space is stunning, but I requested to be seated outside because it couldn't have been a more beautiful morning. The restaurant is massive, each room boasting its own unique character. We sat on the patio on the lower level and were quickly greeted by our charming and charismatic server, Kevin. Kevin, if you're reading this, you are a delight. Thank you for the excellent service and for keeping us upbeat & laughing throughout our dining experience!We had 4 donuts to start. I'm not the world's biggest donut fan, but when I'm at a restaurant known for fresh, unique, homemade donuts, I'm obviously going to try them. We had: Mo Betta Blues (good but my least fave), The Dark Knight (delish, oozing with chocolate), Flan-Tastic (2nd place), and Donkey Kong (the undisputed winner).

My bf and I chose to go here on the 1st of January with no reservations like we were VIP *facepalm* and luckily, they made space for us at the bar. We visited during brunch and it was packed! Despite how busy they were, the team was so attentive to us and they were truly working like a well-oiled machine, buzzing around the restaurant table to table. The menu was so visually cute! We started with mimosas and decided on the ""Nashville Hot"" Glazed Chicken Sandwich for him and the Lobster Roll & Fries for me. I don\'t believe we waited long for our food but after 2 mimosas and great conversation, time is forgotten lol but once we got it - YUM! I had a bite of my partner\'s plate and that sandwich definitely didn\'t stand a chance! It wasn\'t a hugeee sandwich so I just wish it came with a side but luckily he had my fries lol. My Lobster Roll was SO GOOD. The aioli was flavorful, the bun was so buttery and the lobster chunks were HUGE. The price may deter some at first, but it\'s worth every dime and then some.The food, the ambiance, the drinks, the team - I can\'t wait to come back!', ""Our waiter Milo was great, he gave us excellent suggestions. There were so many great items on the menu I didn't know where to begin. I chose the half dozen baked oysters and fry bread as an appetizer and a dozen raw oysters for us all to share. The glacier bay oysters were my favorite. The fry bread is savory with a combination of sweet and salty and the texture is light and fluffy. It's really delicious and paired well with the baked oysters. The youngest of our party ordered the cheese burger from the kids menu and it vanished within seconds. She said it was soooooo good. I ordered the lobster roll and fries which comes out cold on a warm buttery toasted bun. Since the star is the lobster they dont fill the bun with lettuce tomatoes etc. it's just aioli and juicy lobster parts. Now I'm from up north, so I prefer old bay seasoning and that really set my lobster roll off. I even sprinkled some on my fries. Matter of fact they should probably just go ahead and add that option to the menu. Old bay fries! Over all, service was great and the food was delicious.

So what did we order for eating?Mixed Hummus plate ($13)NY Strip ($30)Cineful Chocolate cake ($9.5)Popcorn (Free for us, but otherwise $8.95)So as we were explained by our server, everything comes out at the same time, so if you'd like to start with popcorn, that really just means you eat that first. \xa0Our popcorn came out maybe 30 seconds before everything else so they weren't lying there. \xa0The popcorn was nice and buttery, salted and was in a large bowl easily able to feed two. \xa0Although there were unlimited refills, we didn't get one refill. \xa0This was free for us because we signed up for their VIP membership (free) and received a complimentary free popcorn from it.The mixed hummus plate was pretty stacked actually, and came with Red pepper hummus, white bean hummus with roasted garlic, pickled beets, carrots, celery and Cilantro-garlic buttered naan. \xa0Everything on this plate was a win for us. \xa0Flavor was great and for some, this is 100% a meal. \xa0For the price I think it was worth it.Where CineBistro stumbled was their NY Strip. \xa0I asked for this to be cooked medium,but the steak came out lightning fast and well done. \xa0The steak was pretty salty, although the meat wasn't tough and was easy to cut. \xa0The meat came along with crispy brussel sprouts with cauliflower, caramelized onion, and smoked bone marrow. \xa0The Crispy brussels and cauliflower were crispy indeed, but weren't seasoned at all. \xa0The bone marrow was essentially the bone, with maybe the tip of a spoonful of actual marrow. \xa0There really wasn't enough of it for me to get real flavor from it, but from what I had, it wasn't bad.Lastly was the chocolate cake, which was both nice to look at and delicious. \xa0Silky interior with chocolate on top of chocolate on top of chocolate. \xa0Inside is chocolate mousse and the chocolate exterior is covered in a chocolate and raspberry sauce. \xa0Probably the crowd favorite here. \xa0Get this!In terms of the experience of watching the movie, the theater was pretty standard with nice sound. \xa0The benefit here is the crowd size is much smaller than your average theater and rows are nicely sized so you can get in and out easily.Not quite a 4 star place to me...not yet, but maybe a 3.5, no rounding. \xa0Hopefully you can check it out and tell me what you think!"", 'Holy cow! What a cool place! Perfect for a date night. Allows you to pull the armrests up between you and your date. You can snuggle and cuddle in the love seat type seating arrangement. CinéBistro at Town Brookhaven is an upscale cinema chain serving bistro food, popcorn and cocktails during film screenings. I would definitely recommend ordering tickets in advance to get a good seat towards the back. They try buttering up the front seats by giving you a foot-rest so that people will still order them. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone.Impressive menu that competes with a lot of upscale restaurants. Definitely a place to attend more than once and you will enjoy for sure. Courteous and polite staff. The drinks are always on point. Best of all very comfortable reserved seats with a table attached. If you get there at least 30 minutes before the show, you can order full dinners right at your seat. The service stops a few minutes before the show starts so no one is disturbing you during the movie. They have gluten free choices too and a delicious chocolate dessert that everyone must try. The Salmon and Crab Cakes are the best to order here.We were actually here for a free screening and were also provided a free large Popcorn and a large drink on the house which was really nice. As this movie theater is located in a shopping strip, there is plenty of free parking in front of the theater and they also have a closed free garage parking just besides the movie theater. This mall/plaza also has a Publix, LA Fitness and Costco. Here the sound system is very amazing. The prices are little higher compare to any other places, but you would be satisfied by the services they offer here. Overall the atmosphere is very much relaxing. I will be sure going back again soon.', ""Upscale dinner and a movie experience with an impressive bar. We got to the theater a little early just to order a few drinks and hangout before the movie started. The lounge and bar area was great for that. The bartender wasn't the nicest or very personable but our cocktails were good so I guess I shouldn't complain.The inside of the theater was clean and had really comfortable chairs. Overall, a really good night out.I would definitely return often if I lived in the area."", 'What a dump The seats are torn - not one or two - but all of them.Manager said ""we are refreshing in April"" it\'s January and this didn\'t just happen. \xa0What a ghetto dump.Manager CJ should be fired for his attitude and poor customer service.We ordered food well before the movie started, \xa0lights go down, no food. \xa0A number of us leave to find out where our food is - ""it will be there soon"" no drinks, no popcorn, no bottle of wine while we wait.....Then the \xa0drinks show up - no stand to hold popcorn or wine bucket.Then the food arrives 1.5 hours later and it\'s cold, wrong and just gross.We leave and ask for a refund - refund given and free movie tickets. \xa0Very robotic refund - cause we aren\'t the first ones to ask for it. \xa0Not even am ask to pay for the wine and popcorn. \xa0Why you ask - cause it\'s a ghetto dump.Don\'t go there Stay home and watch on pay per view or hell even RedBox.', 'Y\'all. I don\'t even know what to say. I used to love this theater. I drive an hour to dine and watch movies here. \xa0Before visiting tonight, I\'d last been here about 6 months ago and everything was wonderful. My visit tonight was awful. A LOT has changed here. First, the seats in the theaters are damaged. Just about every seat in the theater was torn. Next, we placed our orders. We\'d already eaten, so we planned to order dessert. The waitress presented a menu that had an apple tart dessert on it. My husband decided to order that. I ordered popcorn and sweet tea. *unrelated* while we were waiting, a waitress spilled red wine on another guest\'s very expensive designer sneakers. Anywho, The items took so long to come out. We were seated and placing our orders 30 minutes prior to the movie starting. When the popcorn finally came it was cold. The apple dessert never came. My husband went out to the counter to ask about it and was told to ""hang on a second"" while they looked into it. He waited a few minutes and no one came back to the window. He came back into the theater so that he wouldn\'t miss too much of the movie. The movie ended and we joined the line of people that needed to speak to the manager for various reasons. The couple next to me never received their entrees. Another gentleman received his entrees, but did not receive drinks. When we spoke to the manager, she informed us that the dessert that we ordered wasn\'t even being served that night. The manager was very gracious (the only reason I didn\'t rate this visit one star) and offered us complimentary passes for our next visit and refunded us for the items that we never received. We appreciate the gesture, but we will not be coming back. This location has taken a turn for the worse.', ""A great, upscale, movie theater! Went on a date night with my BF, every night is date night, to see Justice League. First let me say, this place is pricey, it just is but what movie theater isn't? Get ready to bring some money, drinks (cocktails) run about $12+, food varies based on what you get. Okay, so the customer service is fantastic! The bar is full service and they have EXCELLENT cocktails and drinks. The bartender is very nice and fast :) you can hangout at the bar or outside and just chill.Once you go inside (make sure you go in at least five minutes before the movie starts otherwise you can't order food), it's assigned seating (when you buy tickets you pick your seats). Seats are comfy and they rock but they do not recline. It's clean inside. There's a waiter will come around and take your order but you order it all at once and they bring all the food out at once, so order up! My only issue is that the trays attached to seats are small so they don't hold a lot of food but I've spoken like a fatty bc we ordered a lot of food! Seats are comfy! Drinks: I got the Pink something (yes!!!) and the strawberry mango lemon drop (double yes!!) \xa0do it, they are sweet and girly but good- again, the bartender is killing it!Food: for appetizers we got lamb lollipops and the wagu beef sliders...both amazing and the sliders are a good amount! For the meal, we shared a burger- which was good- I won't lie but not the best burger I've had. Nevertheless, it's was good! For dessert we got crème brûlée and a Smore thingy. I wasn't a fan of the snore but the crème brûlée is amazing!! I've been here twice and I'm a fan. I go here no more than twice a year bc it can get pricey but it's a great date spot. Lots of parking but it can fill up fast. In a great area with plenty of other places to eat incase you didn't want the food at the movies! Definitely recommend going, we had a great time! Upgraded to 5 stars, food gotten better and great menu variety! Still expensive but still amazing. Still an excellent date spot! Go see it!"", ""OMG this place is amazing. I've never had waited service at a movie theater! Make sure you arrive at your movie like 30 mins before so that you can comfortable browse the menu and order. There is even a bar area if you want to hang out before the movie.The seats have seen better days, and I've been in theaters that have much nicer reclining seats, but I really just came for the cocktails and to watch crazy rich Asians like the bougie half Asian that I am. The cocktails were good. I ordered a sangria and a watermelon mojito, both brought before the movie started. They were sweet and strong and made the movie even better than the first two times I saw it. The bathrooms were super classy and I liked how everyone working looks so fancy. Parking wasn't an issue and picking up our prepaid tickets was a breeze. I definitely recommend this place. I'm used to paying $12-$15 for shitty movie theater seats, so this felt like a deal!""]",negative

"[""Came here on a date! The atmosphere is very cute and quaint. SO YUMMY! I got the two dish Combination order with beef teriyaki and sashimi! The order also came with house salad and a bowl of miso. The beef teriyaki is perhaps one of THE best I've ever had! And the sashimi selection is chef's choice and it simply was a delight! Each sashimi really did melt in my mouth! A very hearty and satisfying meal! I hope more people find out about Sushi Yoko! Will be supporting Sushi Yoko! And will be coming back soon!"", ""It's alright. You have to know what to expect though. The interior is super dated. It takes you right back to the 80s (not that I would know though since I was born late 90s). And the restaurant is hidden in the back of a building that also houses a small but authentic Japanese supermarket. Don't expect anything too nice inside and it's not a nice first date spot. But the food is authentic. Sushi Yoko is quite understaffed with minimal waiters and only one sushi chef. So they said it's quite a wait for the food.All of the sashimi/nigiri was super fresh and tasty. I liked all of them except for maybe the squid which was too slimy even for someone who relatively likes squid. Super authentic, quiet and dated, tucked in the back of an old building. It feels truly like a secret, hole in the wall place. But honestly, I prefer Tanaka in Roswell if you are looking for a small hole in the wall authentic Japanese cuisine place. Sushi Yoko is definitely worth a try though as it is an extremely unique experience. It's fun to stop by the Japanese supermarket to pick up some Japanese snacks you can't find at the other Asian supermarkets (mostly Korean or Chinese)."", ""My boyfriend and I went here for dinner after a hike. The food was mediocre but not terrible, the curry being too sweet and lacking some sort of punch. The takoyaki was normal takoyaki nothing bad about it there. We ordered the teriyaki beef tongue as our other appetizer it was alright however I wouldn't recommend as it's tastes like a less tender piece of galbi. All in all the food was mediocre at best (the curry worse than mediocre). HOWEVER, within 15 minutes of eating at this restaurant both he and I had stomach pain and ultimately had bad indigestion."", ""Sushi Yoko has OG-Japanese vibes of being in restaurant in countryside Japan. This reminds me of my days working in Atsugi and spending countless nights eating late nite sushi and sakana with colleagues from a far. The place is not looking to be on an episode of HGTV, but more so the Food Network. The decor is minimalistic, location is just outside of ITP, and it is a blast from the past ambiance that questions whether we are in Asia or Atlanta Menu is fairly extensive and prices are consistent with other Japanese restaurants. Ordered- Katsu Curry (4/5). Hot, savory, and hits the spot with some fluffy white rice. - Takoyaki Balls (3.5/5). It was a-ok. Not what I was expecting- Yakitori (3/5). A little let down from what I usually associate Japanese bbq skewers with. This was bland and felt a bit dry - Tempura (5/5). Delicious. Lightly coated with batter and the sauce enhanced it- Sashimi Platter (5/5). Melts in your mouth goodness. It's been a while since I have had good sushi and this was what I needed. Chase it with some wasabi and white rice and you're good to go - Beef Teriyaki (5/5). Wow, this was a surprise. I was not expecting it to be all that special but the medium well preparation, sauce, and cabbage was a winning combinationSushi Yoko is a historic Japanese restaurant and represents some of the diversity that this city has to offer. Enjoy!"", ""Ordered their Combination and picked Beef Teriyaki, Tempura, and the sushi. It also came with a small salad and miso soup.The beef teriyaki was actually VERY good and probably my favorite part of the combination - it was more like a steak to me. It was very tender and almost melted in your mouth. The teriyaki sauce was delicate but definitely enhanced the flavor. The tempura plate was huge and came with an assortment of shrimp, sweet potato, and squash with dipping sauce. The sauce was very helpful in cutting the oiliness of the tempura and overall was pretty good as well. The nigiri came in an assortment of 5 - shrimp, salmon, tuna, and two others I can't quite place. All made fresh and each one super delicious. I'm not a big wasabi fan, so I could have done without the bit of wasabi tucked under each fish, personally. Service was also super kind, though a little slow since it was pretty busy with few staff members. It's a little big of a walk going into the building and walking all the way down to the restaurant, so you may need to do a little hunting for it. A very cozy atmosphere once inside, though."", ""This place's food is nice but their service is VERY unkind and unfair. We had to wait almost 1hours with the Togo and they did not say a word of sorry. Also people who came before us have already eaten and left. So if your going to this place do not expect a kind and respectful manner."", ""We have been going to this restaurant on and off for many years ever since I was still in school.In the past, I usually ordered sashimi or chirashi sushi/don for when we dine in with family.

I needed help bc there's no online site.This review is setting service aside.I got the sushi/sashimi lunch special. The sashimi was WAY too small but I suppose a decent price is why. The fish did not look particularly good but upon eating tasted fresh. The ginger looked old and questionable but tasted fine. I got the nabeyaki udon which was full of flavor but I didn't like that the tempura was so soaked and soggy into pieces upon pickup. I wish they could have packed it separately. I even arrived early too for pickup! The takoyaki was some of the best I've had. Overall good tasting food for a decent price but I didn't care for the side salad that came with the lunch special and nabeyaki. The dressing was meh.

I thought we were going to \xa0have a good Night out at an extremely high and beautiful environment.That could not be further from the truth. When we finally could figure out how to get into the grounds on which the restaurant was located it was extremely disappointing. We couldn't even figure out where the front entrance or main entrance was to the restaurant. We finally realize that the rickety, shabby stairs, Front porch and dilapidated overhang was the main entrance.As we entered inside it looks like this place has not been remodeled since the 1980s. We entered into an L-shaped Corredor with no windows, a dirty uneven floor and walls painted with fading chipped Japanese anime characters.When we finally got to the inside entrance of the restaurant it was a four pane glass door. As you entered into the actual restaurant which was a smaller version of the entirely large building, you saw the kitchen to your right. I glanced in and noticed the floor was filthy and it did not look clean or sanitary whatsoever.As we continue to walk into the restaurant I saw a small table with some items sitting on it and the tablecloth was stained and filthy. As we came up on the booths for dining they looks like they were straight out of the 1980s mauve colored benches and forward top tables. The walls were adorned with what looked like slat board Pine colored wood.When we sat down we were not offered menus, we were told we could use the QR Code taped to the tables if we wanted to see the menu. They refused to even provide a paper menu for us to view. Nothing in this place looks to be updated upgraded clean or sanitary.It took a while to figure out what they had on the menu for Vegan. I opted for the vegetable tempura a seaweed salad and avocado rolls.My friends ordered different and assorted sushi.Once the seaweed salad arrived at the table I took a few bites and it seemed like it was not fresh. It had a strange flavor they told me it could've been old and on verge of spoiling.The vegetable tempura was uneventful, I ate it with some soy sauce and wasabi. The avocado seaweed rolls were small I did not appear to be fresh. The rice served with the meal was not moist it was clumpy dry and hard in some kernels. I eat my food anyway. I chased it down with water a Japanese beer and some warm psaki. Psaki was truly the only thing that I enjoyed.We paid our bill and left. It was an uneventful, ugly environment, good service but poor quality of food. The outside of the building looked as anxious and dilapidated an unattended to as the rest of the interior. It looked like it had seen a hurricane and never been repaired or painted.I have no interest in ever returning to that restaurant. At 2 AM in the morning I woke with stomach pain, grumbling and turning. Eventually I had to address the truth, I was about to throw up. I ran to the bathroom leaned over the toilet and threw up four times. Everything that came out of my stomach threw my throat burned and then all of it was the food I ate at this so-called Japanese restaurant.All in all it was a hideous experience and I suffered the pain of it at 2 o'clock in the morning and I'm still feeling sickly today. I do not recommend this place for takeout, dining or delivery.""]",negative

Alright, expectation reset. 1) It's not the best grade sushi in town. Look at their prices. But you get well over what you paid for. 2) Their house roll (the Phoenix) is a cooked and deep fried tuna roll. The tuna is somewhat on the dry side. I personally think it's decent for one of those complimentary rolls, but don't make this your main roll and you should be solid.3) Their nigiri rolls (fish and rice only) have wasabi under them. I hate wasabi. I always ask them to remove it when I order. If I forget, I suffer having to scrape it off and still get strong wasabi flavor with my sushi. If you don't like wasabi...there you go.

We'd never been here but heard great things and we asked the waitress a few questions to help us determine what we wanted. We got 2 sushi rolls, one was the Big Fire Roll and the other the Tsunami Roll. We received miso before the meal which is always a welcomed treat. The portions of the rolls were huge! Not what we were expecting at all and the flavors were on point for each one. My plus one was only able to eat a few rolls of his due to the size of the roll and he ate the leftovers the following day and said they were still delicious. I really appreciated my roll due to the level of spice and flavor. I usually smother my rolls in wasabi and it was flavorful enough without that being added.

All the restaurants and businesses were busy and super popular.  \xa0 \xa0As for Gideons this location has a preorder pick up and a stand by line and with basically no wait at all compared to the Disney Location. The staff was super friendly and helpful to what cookie was what and the special that day. As for the cookie themselves they are a 1/2 pound cookie covered in semi sweet chips and delicious. If your not a fan of a ton of chocolate chips then these cookies might not be for you but you should still give them a shot because they are pretty tasty! \xa0 Just a note if you are looking for their cold brew they do not have it at this location."", ""Approximately a few months ago I went to Disney Springs and the wait was approximately 1 to 2 hours. I decided to go into their store in the east end market today. Walked in at 10:00am and was out the door in a couple minutes. No wait. Ordered a slice of cake. Very good. Very dense and reminds you of a pound cake texture. Little too much filling for me. Ordered 2 chocolate chipCookies, triple chocolate and the seasonal chocolate cherry spicy cookie. We all liked the triple chocolate which was very dense reminds you of eating a brownie. The chocolate chip was good. The spicy chocolate cherry one was way too spicy even for the people who love spicy food. I took one bite of it and I was done. We all agreed the spicy cherry chocolate was the one we didn't like. My mouth was on fire. Love the packaging. Customer service was great. Cookies are pricey for $6.00 each and a slice of cake was $8.00. They do not provide military discounts.You can preorder your cookies for the next day Just look on their website for their live link for next day preorders. You can only do it at their east end market location. You can not do it at their Disney location. Glad I went but I would not wait for cookies for a couple hours at their Disney location. It is a special treat but wouldn't be a normal weekly purchase for me. I actually preferred the slice of cake over the cookies."", ""I LOVE Gideons! I first went to the location at Disney Springs but the wait there one day was over 3 hours long so my friend and I decided to visit the smaller location. They don't have the same cool all over aesthetic they do in Disney Springs, but they share the space with other small businesses so it's scaled down quite a bit. Entrance and line for the bakery is in the courtyard area. I love all the cakes they make and their cookies are pretty good too! I even took some back to my mom in AZ and TSA knew how good it is, they let me keep my cake! Definitely give this place a try and help them expand their business! You won't be disappointed!!"", ""The hype is worth it! It's a pretty wait but they do let you out your name down and they will text you to come back. The peanut butter cookies are so good! Nice and soft and filled with goodness! Definitely try their lattes too! I absolutely love the chocolate chip pistachio"", ""I ended up with original chocolate chip & the pistachio toffee chocolate chip. Gideon's handmade cookies are nearly a half pound each...so 1 lb cookie coma should do the trick!Gideon's Bakehouse has two locations; one in East End Market and the other in Disney Springs. I visited the one in east end \xa0, where the wait usually reasonable compared to Disney springs.""]",positive
"['Great beer (of course)! Wonderful food (appreciate the delicious vegetarian and vegan options)! Service is always friendly and prompt! Bathrooms really put it over the top, though. The auto sinks flow smoothly at a pleasant temp (my hands are always cold) and the lighting is very flattering!', ""Really great brewpub with outstanding food. This place is huge. Lots of rare Deschutes beers you can't buy elsewhere."", ""My family hadn't been to the Deschutes Brewery location in the Pearl District since pre-pandemic, and we were expecting the usual line and long wait when we went for lunch, but it was nearly empty. This was on a weekday, so I bet the weekends are still busy, but it was nice not to have to wait during this visit. The beers are still solid and the food is good -- not blow-your-mind amazing or full of culinary creativity, just good, solid brewery restaurant grub. Burgers, sandwiches, basic salads, fries. My son enjoyed the chicken and waffles (the chicken is spicy!), and I enjoyed my half Caesar salad with added smoked salmon. The mini waffle chips on top are a nice touch and way better than classic croutons. The service was good, although a little slow toward the end, considering the place was not very busy. Still a great spot for groups and families, and such a great location if you're hanging out in the Pearl District."", ""Came in on our last day in Portland, which happened to be on President's Day at around 5:30. It wasn't too crowded, so that is our type of place. \xa0We originally were thinking about sharing a flight, but whenever we get flights at breweries, we don't have a lot of luck. They're usually half IPAs (which we don't like) or we just end up liking one of two of the pours. So we decided to just get what we wanted and it was the best decision. I had the Nitro Horchata Stout because stouts are my thing and I really liked it. It was smooth like a Guinness but had a hint of cinnamon. My husband had the Rev Nat's Valley of the Pear. He liked it. I can see it being really refreshing but I tried it after the stout, so I can't really give it a fair assessment. Overall, it was a nice experience. The decor is very cabin in the woods but in a fun way, not a creepy way. They also have some souvenirs for sale so we ended up buying a couple of mini draft glasses to add to our beer glass collection."", 'We just got done hiking around Forest Park and touring Pittock Mansion and we were super hungry. On top of that, it was my birthday, so of course I chose to go to a brewery.We went with the ""when in Rome"" beer flight. We loved all but one of them (can\'t remember the name). As for the food, we ordered the IPA Pretzel with beer cheese, mustard, and bacon jam (super good).For entrees, I got the Mac and she ordered a shrimp pasta dish. We both thoroughly enjoyed our choices. The service was really good. Our waiter was super on top of things. We would definitely go back.', ""Always excited to go to a brewery in Portland.

On to the food...Garlic fries: 4/5 huge portion and tasty Elk burger: 4/5 cooked to perfection and love their aioli sauce.

It's been many years since I last visited this place -- food and service have always been on point. I just stopped in for beer today so I will update my review when I stay longer and try more on the menu.I sat at the bar and tried six samples. While I usually am a fan of their beer, today I struggled to like even one. I don't know if it was just the pours or what. I really wanted to rave about my flight but just felt like they were lacking today from flavor to mouthfeel.Service was great though. I'll be back hopefully with a more positive review in the future!"", 'We don\'t usually equate ""brewery"" with ""good food"", so we were pleasantly surprised by the quality meals we got at Deschutes. We were so pleased, in fact, that we broke our own travel rules and dined at Deschutes twice during our trip.They have a large space, with a first-come, first-served bar area on one side, and an expansive dining area on the other. They also have outdoor seating, but we were there in the middle of November, so of course that part was closed.Service was great and friendly on both visits. The two waitresses we interacted with were helpful and knowledgeable, and eager to answer our questions about the beers on tap and my initial request to build my own flight.On our first night, I ordered the Grilled Cheese sandwich, and opted for the roasted red pepper bisque that came standard with the meal ($14.50). My husband ordered the Pub Burger ($16.25) and opted for the side salad. With my beer flight creation and the pints my husband ordered, we were off to a good start.Look, I know it\'s difficult to ""mess up"" a grilled cheese sandwich, so I wasn\'t expecting much from the meal. I just wanted something not-too-filling and warm. The grilled cheese version Deschutes serves as a meal is not your regular sandwich. The bread was artisan and felt fancy, in the way it crisped up and in the flavor it provided. But the bisque was the star of the meal. Not only was it warm (remember, that was my number one criteria), it was flavorful and creamy, a little velvety and a tiny bit roasty. I would\'ve gotten just a bowl of that and called it a day.My husband made short work of the burger, which he said was really well put-together and tasty. And though it had the nice ""put-together"" presentation that he initially commented on, it did kind of fall apart as he was eating it. He ended up using a knife and fork to finish the burger.On our next visit, I went straight for a bowl of soup, which happened to be Cream of Mushroom ($9) and a small house salad ($7). My husband ordered the Pear and Bacon Salad ($15) and we supplemented with an order of Chicken Wings ($13.50). The wings were a bit much, given the amount of food we had. They were decent, but I wouldn\'t get them again. Neither of us expected the salad my husband ordered to be so very big. They filled that salad bowl full of greens and thick-cut bacon, which my husband enjoyed immensely. Meanwhile, I was quickly falling in love with the cream of mushroom soup. It sounds so bland, doesn\'t it? I don\'t know what they did in the creation of said soup, but it ended up with a magical smooth, earthy, creamy concoction that I polished off in no time.The beers we ordered over the two visits were also quite tasty, and we did end up with our favorites (mine was the Spun Honey and the Jubelale, my husband loved the Ludwig Von Crispy and the Altbierior Motive).', ""My friend and I were in town visiting Portland for my birthday and we had a night without a reservation so we decided to stop by Deschutes Brewery. One thing to keep in mind is that this place is huge and extremely crowded. The ambience is much like a brewery and the noise level is fairly loud due to the amount of people packed into one place. We waited about an hour to be sat on a weekend, but we were fine with that because we were on vacation. Upon being sat, the service was fairly slow which was expected but once we did get service we ordered the following:1) Pub Burger - The burger was good, met expectations for a burger. Was cooked medium and had good flavor. However, they did forget the avocado that we added.2) Garlic Fries - My favorite dish that we ordered. The fries were cooked perfectly. They were generous of the cheese on top. Came out hot and was very delicious. Highly recommend!3) House Salad - Was as expected except for they forgot to again add the [cheddar] cheese because it came without any cheese. They were very forgiving with their mistake and gave us a salad on the house, which was very nice! 4) Mac and Cheese - We were not big fans of the mac and cheese. Contrary to most other mac and cheese dishes we have tried, this dish had the consistency of soup. We did not enjoy the flavor as well. I think this type of mac and cheese is really dependent on the person and preference. Overall, with all things considered we enjoyed this restaurant. If you are new to Portland, this isn't a bad place to try if you are looking for a large selection of food and beers, and a laid back atmosphere.""]",positive

There was one that i saw, it said biscotti. So I typically like biscotti's too so I ordered it. It was actually just cookies and cream. hahaha.

It was a tasty way to finish the night after Antico pizza.The outside seating area is beautiful. They have many places to sit with friends and chat outside. We sat in comfy wicker chairs under an umbrella. There's also another area with a large television playing. The NBA Finals were on when I was there, so it was great fun to chat with friends while glancing over to the game. Not to mention, we could all enjoy the beautiful weather that night since the area is so open! Be careful though, if it is a rainy night, there's only little seating inside. There are those covered tables outside too, but you'd probably still get wet.

The best part is how cute it looks from the outside. The people serving the ice cream weren't particularly friendly and they don't offer samples. The strawberry did not taste natural at all and was grossly sweet. The hazelnut almost tasted like nothing. (Note that the flavors were written in Italian, but translate to strawberry and hazelnut). I tried my friend's peanut butter flavor which was better than mine. The chocolate was also just sub-par. The experience was a waste of calories. I paid almost $4 for a regular cup of brewed coffee; actually, half of a cup. I felt the cup was light and took off the top to find the cup was only filled HALFWAY. Sometimes they leave room for creamer (I like it when they check first, which no one did), but this was far beyond that. I took it back to the counter and the woman basically disclosed that she'd hoped I hadn't noticed or liked a lot of creamer. She had given me the bottom of the pot and they'd run out.

It was loud with both the oreo and peanut butter flavors.... complimented each other so well. Not too sweet either. Every other flavor I tried was WAY too sweet for me after ONE bite.

Solid, but nothing breath taking for me', 'Like peanut butter and jelly, two things that absolutely go together... Portland, Oregon and Voo Doo Doughnuts. Like their saying goes: """"the magic is in the hole."""" And they ain\'t wrong. Is it still considered a hole-in-the-wall if this place has a bunch of reviews? LOL. Maybe it\'s the sparkly pink walls, the quirky staff, or odd doughnut names that keep Yelpers coming back for more--nonetheless, as toursity as my friends who now call Portland home say Voo Doo Doughnuts is, I will keep coming back everytime I visit this strangely alluring city. The place is an attraction in its own. On our last visit, VDD had its share of street artists lining the sidewalk outside in addition to the flocks of other people lining up to get their hands on these sweet treats. Delicious? Yes. A little too sweet for my liking, but tasty nonetheless. Some of my favorites? I love a good ol\' maple bacon doughnut. But I can\'t forget about their signature voodoo doll doughnut and their cinnamon treat, shaped and decorated like a blunt (super similar to a malasada-covered in cinnamon and sugar).', ""Finally made my way into Voodoo after almost 3 years of living in Portland! I have passed by this location many, many times and have never had the urge to stop by up until recently. What's nice is that Voodoo is open 24/7 so we decided to stop in for some goodies the other evening. It was a week day so we didn't have to wait long. We only waited about 2-3 minutes since they currently allow 2 parties in at a time. I've heard weekends are a different story though. There are lots of flavors to choose from with menus everywhere and upon entering the space, you're almost immediately greeted with the iconic rotating case of donuts. My boyfriend and I shared the Portland Cream, Old Dirty Bastard, and Apple Fritter and honestly, the donuts were not bad! I never had high expectations because the toppings just seemed so over the top for me. Definitely more on the sweet side but the actual dough of the donuts were fluffy - I enjoyed that the most really. The Portland Cream was good but a bit underwhelming - I was excited for this one the most but felt a little disappointed. Old Dirty Bastard was fun but leans on the sweet side, even for someone like me who has a huge sweet tooth. Our favorite was the Apple fritter - The more simple, the better tbh. Fun donuts to grab and check out for the first time but won't be my go to."", ""Having been to Portland for years, I've never stepped into this donut shop just cause the lines are so long.

Flavors are spot on and although the outside frostings and such are sweet, the donut itself is not overly sweet.We will definitely be coming back. The only downside is no parking."", ""This place is pretty touristy and the line is a bit long, but still worth trying. They have a huge selection of donuts - chocolate, cream filled, jelly filled, maple flavored, etc. I tried their maple cream donut and it was quite good! At only $2.75, the donut is a good deal because not only is it large, it's also stuffed with plenty of cream. I liked that the cream wasn't overly sweet and that they added some cute white decorative swirls on top."", 'Five years in Portland and it was finally time to try VooDoo. There was no line after dinner in the area so we popped in real quick. Right now during COVID, they\'re only allowing one ordering group into the store at a time so it was a slight wait even with just a few folks ahead of us. Thankfully there\'s a menu out front so you can plan ahead. The store is cool, pink and odd and edgy and decorated. It certainly has its own vibe, which was unique back in the day. It doesn\'t feel like they\'re trying too hard in my opinion. The rotating display is fun and mesmerizing. Staff was cordial. My ""dirt"" oreo-based donut was pretty good. Nice bonus that it\'s one of their vegan/dairy free (?) options. My partner\'s donuts - ""butterfingering"" and something blueberry - tasted fairly stale. Like they were day-olds or sitting out. That\'s one of out three for those keeping score at home. At least they were cheap. I wouldn\'t wait in line for it.

It was not mentioned by the hotel staff when I asked, but I wanted seafood and decided to try it anyway. The parking lot (and dinning room) was empty (Monday at 6:35pm), which I normally take as a bad sign of things to come. But, like I said, I wanted seafood and I will not be denied when I set my mind on something. I was promptly greeted (by the manager?) and shown to my table. Walking through the restaurant, I thought I might be underdressed based on the cloth napkins and place settings, but upon sitting down, realized the tablecloth was actually paper-probably a smart choice at a fish restaurant, especially if you have ever seen the way I eat crab legs. I ordered the calamari as an appetizer. It wasn\'t overcooked, but because the pieces were thick, they were hard to pick up with a fork. They were certainly fresh from the oil, as I had to turn the cone shaped pieces over to let them drain first. After about 5 pieces, I decided that the oil and the thick, sponginess were too much for me. Here\'s where I give kudos for attentiveness, the manger came over and told me she had taken the calamari off my bill since I didn\'t like it. What prompted this? Me simply telling my waitress that they were ""okay"" and my not eating much of it. Very good service and attentiveness here!Okay, I\'ll be more brief with the rest of my experience. I ordered the snow crab legs with red potatoes and rice. Very good! \xa0The crab shells were stiff, allowing me to extract full chunks of crab meat at a time. Awesome! \xa0Potatoes and rice were good. I love the green dip/spread that comes with the bread. Finally, I ordered the carrot cake, which I ws told, was made in house! \xa0This too was very good!Without gratuity (& the calamari) the check was $34, thus the nice place settings.

I ordered the calamari salad and it was yum! \xa0Niki came by to tell me that their calamari is not pre-breaded; they bread it (and lightly too I might add) before they prepare it for you. \xa0And I forget what that green stuff is that they serve with the bread (olive oil, green peppers, and other herbs - looks like green goddess dressing but tastier) but it is addictive. \xa0I kept telling myself I was canceling out the badness of the carbs by having olive oil. \xa0My story and I'm sticking to it! \xa0Both Niki and my server, Lisa, were so wonderfully attentive to me that day. By the time I left I felt as if I had known them for years. \xa0Since then I have gone back a couple more times with hubs and have had this melt in your mouth sesame ahi tuna, lobster cakes (please a little more lobster and a little less cake, thank you) with this sweet mango papaya chutney (it was just a bit too sweet, glad I had it on the side instead of on the cakes), a spicy red snapper (if you are not a spicy food fan like us, this may not be your dish), and a pretty darn good key lime pie. \xa0They do serve land creatures too. \xa0I am eyeballing those feta crusted lamb chops for a future meal.I truly appreciate the fact that they are cognizant of potential food allergies and many of their foods do not contain known allergens (ie. nuts for one). \xa0Lisa, our server, still remembers what foods I am allergic to!!

I had stuffed flounder for my entree, which was fine, and the wife had the seared yellowfin tuna steak, which was cooked (rare) to perfection, with a perfect blackened seasoning.We had some sort of chocolate cake thing for dessert that was good. They had a great selection of after-dinner drinks (I had a single malt scotch that I'd never had before, aberlour, which was on the sweet side, but a really great finish).The fresh fruit cocktails were good too. Wife had a skinny margarita, which was on the sweet side for me, and I had a skinny lemon drop, which was perfect. Prices were entirely reasonable, service was great--I think our waiter was named Plummen, but I'm not positive--atmosphere was nice. My only wish would be a wider range of fish on offer, but I was still happy with what was available.

I could pour it over everything.My coworker had a fish dish which she enjoyed and it was quite the large plate.I have to say as far as quality of plating and pricing are really great.

The bread (ciabatta looking) was tasty and so was the dipping sauce (probably lemon and basil based something or other).Cons: it took quite a while for us to get our entrees, so i was wondering what happened. probably a good 20 mins before we got our plates. weird since there weren't that many other people there. the pasta had probably 3 sticks of butter and cream. WAY too heavy and a fat slap in your face. My wife's fish was bland, and her steamed veggie medley was laughable, like 1 puny broccoli and 3carrots with random other stuff... very sparing on the sides.From a non-food perspective, it was very good.

In fact, if I lived in the northeast corner of New Hampshire, I would have to make the trip at least 3-4 times a year.When entering the restaurant, it feels as if you are stepping back in time. The entire staff treats you as if you are a long-lost relative that they have been dying to meet and always shower us with care. I have friends who\'ve come here for 25 years and they can affirm this to be so. What to get: fajitas rancheros and DEFINITELY get the charro beans. The meat is tender, overflowing with flavor and extremely addictive. Legend has it that an Austin businessman once offered the owner of Habaneros $100,000 for the fajita meat recipe but was refused. I guess he remembered the words of Solomon that say, ""If a man were to give all the riches of his house for love, It would be utterly despised,"" when he refused. It\'s that good. If you\'re looking for fajitas and you\'re in Austin I can\'t imagine going anywhere else--unless it\'s 3 AM and you\'re dying--I guess in that case you could go to Denny\'s. 5 stars. Will be back.

The main pot pies come with a side salad. But it lacked flavor, seasoning and was a real disappointment.

It went down well and kept on going as he got sick later in the day while we were traveling home. I didn't try it. The Chicken Pot pie was more soupy in consistency, thin soup that is. The Shepherd'd pie still didn't have flavor after adding lots of salt and pepper. The Beef Roll was ok but nothing to write home about. The Quiche Lorraine was actually the best thing we ordered from there, but by then the disappointment had racked up lots of points that I didn't bother trying their sweet pies.

I also ordered a regular sized clam chowder and a chicken pot pie, coming with a side salad that had avocadoes and balsamic vinegar. I found that although the ratio of pastry to chowder for the mini clam chowder was off, the ratio for the regular size was perfect.

The pink one was a tad too sweet for me personally, but was great mixed with the regular. With Covid, they served everything with disposable recyclable plates and cutlery, which was great for if you couldn't finish or wanted to enjoy it at home.

It's very thick and buttery, with a very nice light crumbly/flaky texture. Strong apple and cinnamon taste. Also topped with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream. Bumble Berry Tart: Super fresh and generous portion of blueberry's (glazed). Great crust as usual. Spinach Quiche: I had this to-go, and reheated it in my oven that night, and it still tasted great. Cheesy and pairs great with the buttery crust. Pecan Pie: Pecans were fresh, and crunchy. Overall it was on the slightly sweeter side, but the toasted pecans were addicting. Coffee Latte: Beautiful latte art, smooth tasting coffee. Frozen Cappuccino: Not too sweet, perfect to sip on. Coffee flavour is light. Whipped cream on top, and stir well. Iced Latte: Milky and served with whipped cream. They use paper straws which is better for the environment too.

I have to honestly say that when I ordered, if I knew it was this place I probably would have passed and found something else. So I'm glad that I didn't pay attention to what the pics of the outside looked like when I searched Yelp for close Asian food. lolOur plan for dinner was Panda Express however that got ruined as we had to wait at the resort for something and e we were not able to make it workout with their hours. Sooo hungry and wanting Asian cuisine I turn to Yelp to search nearby places. Sakura was the second one on my list and open until 11pm. Read some reviews and looked good so we proceeded with placing the order for pickup. Ready in 20 minutes! Went to pickup and I was immediately like oh man! It's this place! But kept a positive vibe and all worked out. Pleasantly impressed with the food. We ordered the Krab Rangoon, Korean Beef Bulgogi, Beef in black bean sauce, and Tom Yum Gai. The soup was a bit overly spiced for my throat and made me cough so I opted to not eat it. Hubs liked it though. The bulgogi was on the sweeter side but the meat was so tender and just overall flavor was good. The beef in black bean sauce was my favorite!! It wasn't overly sweet and came with a variety of veggies. The meat was also very tender and almost melt in your mouth good. The Krab Rangoon was very good. The pastry shell was thinner than most which I enjoyed. The filling was not also only cream. Nice balance. Portion sizes are big and we shared. Staff was VERY friendly and our food was fresh and hot. We have definitely found a place we can come when we stay in the area which is quite frequently."", ""Legit Asian food serving quality and delectable dishes. The restaurant was packed and servers were able to seat everyone efficiently. Just trust in their process...Once you get your grub - you'll be feasting like a Queen or King. Tip: Not sure if it's a thing in FL, but gratuity was added automatically."", ""Doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food is so delicious! Honestly, just get it because you won't regret it. We ordered the pepper steak, green vegetable curry with tofu, kids teriyaki chicken, summer rolls (spring rolls), tuna sushi, and a fresh coconut. (Spend the extra and get a coconut. So refreshing, you deserve it!)Enjoy."", ""Honestly I had very low expectations for this place and I'm glad I was wrong. The food was phenomenal , the portions were generous and the service was warm and inviting. I originally went to grab takeout for my grandparents, and ended up getting a couple of items for myself and other members of the family. We ordered the pepper steak, shrimp fried rice, veg fried rice it was well seasoned, full of flavor and perfect for sharing. I'd definitely recommend over the other fast food restaurants, it took about 10mins to fill the order."", ""I don't know who is giving this five stars... maybe people who don't eat Asian food on the regular.I am in Orlando on a conference and wanted to get some pho. The traffic was so bad that I ended up swinging in here because it had great reviews and was 1 mile closer. I chose poorly.They were very busy so I thought that was a good sign. It was not. This is the worst pho I have ever had. The reason for this review is that my meat was very grizzly and there was even pieces of grizzle in the broth. I have never had grizzly beef in pho.The servers were working very hard so I can't fault them. Would not recommend."", ""Disappointed after seeing pics and other reviews. Just ok for Chinese Fusion take out. Proximity to Disney means $$$. Standard Chinese dishes were all right. Sushi was expensive ($40) and totally not worth the cost. \xa0California roll was small pieces and just ok. Chef choice Nigiri didn't taste fresh like it should.""]",positive
"[""One of the best meals I've had!!! Here, there, everywhere. What an amazing spot! Excellent ambiance and even better food. The quality is truly next level. Every single dish was top notch!

Additionally, our server was next level! I so wish I remembered his name. These are the serves that absolutely deserve 20+%. He was so knowledgeable and just all around excellent!

I was totally blown away by almost every dish that i was served. The bread with olive oil dip was such a wonderful intro to the meal. Freshly baked crusty French bread. Cant go wrong. The scallops were absolutely amazing. Perfectly charred and cooked, melt in your mouth goodness. So fresh and succulent. The beef wellington was simply outstanding. Not many establishments offer this, so i just had to order it. \xa0Chef G. Ramsey would be proud! \xa0The entree came pipping hot out of the oven. The pastry was perfectly cooked. The beef inside seared just right, still pink in the centre and sMoky on the outside. Perfect execution by a master chef. The mushroom risotto...another masterpiece. \xa0Cooked to perfection. The proper arborio rice was used and quality mushrooms adorned the dish. Not dry but not too wet either. Excellent consistency and the rice cooked and ladled perfectly. The dish told me that time and effort were put in when the dish was being cooked. It was handled with precision timing and by capable hands. \xa0Next the grilled rack of lamb! \xa0Simply amazing!! Roasted perfectly. Juicy and moist and devoid of the usual lamb smell. With a nice touch of chimichuri sauce to complement the dish. \xa0Nice fat to meat ration as well.Each bite bursting with flavour. The only let down of the night for me was the wagyu. For such a delicate cut and quality of meat, it was a bit burnt and over cooked. At this stage, any cut and quality of meat would taste the same.It will be hard to tell and taste the difference. The dessert ...mascarpone cheesecake \xa0with sorbet was a perfect ending to a lovely meal. Totally cleansed the palette and re-awakened the taste buds. I would surely go again to try the other entrees. Never a dull moment with elisa. Cheers! Happy eating!', ""I had a pleasant experience here taking an out of town friend to one of the most talked about steakhouses in Vancouver. \xa0Overall, I didn't think it was lifechanging, but the food and drinks were certainly well done. \xa0Our waiter and the staff at the desk were very accommodating and showed us great hospitality. \xa0I liked how the waiter had time for interpersonal communication and some small talk with us despite being so busy with other tables, and that made such a great impression. \xa0I appreciated the flexibility in being able to switch from a indoor table to one on the heated patio, as well as the coat check. \xa0Shoutout to the sommelier for having such an extensive wine list to peruse through, and you're going to need several minutes for sure to look through the textbook. \xa0My friend and I got the Bethel Heights 2018 Pinot Noir as a bottle and it was a very easy drinker type red for me, who enjoys wine appreciation but doesn't drink reds often. \xa0It had a lovely magenta, violet color and an aged, fruity palate without being overly smoky. \xa0The cocktails were alright and the Charring the Cosmos was really good, with my friend wanting to recreate it at home.I did enjoy how the meats embodied the woody flavours of the grill, but I actually remember giving props to how well done the sides of brussel sprouts and foraged mushrooms were. \xa0That was the star of the meal for me.The washrooms are amazing btw."", ""First and foremost, the service is impeccable. I am a firm believer in a restaurants success is not solely on the food but includes the service as well.When you walk in, the restaurant is MASSIVE.

Our server (I really wish I remember her name) was super sweet. Went over the menu well, and when she didn't know what to suggest for wine, she was honest and sent the sommelier over. The sommelier also suggested wines that were various in price range (not all expensive which was nice, since some bottles go for $300+). We chose a nice California Pinot noir that he suggested and went well with everything we ordered. The food.... OMG. Soooooo good. I have nothing bad to say other than that the side were slightly salty for my taste, but I do prefer my food a little bit on the not so salty side (which, when I do go back, I will ask them to make it not so salty). We shared the 20oz together, cooked perfectly, suuuuuuch good flavour. Seriously l, my mouth waters when I still think about it. The tuna tartare is a MUST! the sides we stuck to veggies, again yummy but slightly salty for my taste.

Their oysters are excellent and they have a very extensive liquor list. The service is great too.', ""This is a classified modern 5-star steak house! I have to give it a 4 though because the open-kitchen concept revealed to us an entire line of chefs not wearing their masks. Was a bit concerning! Otherwise all staff directly interacting with guests were masked and vaccination checks are in place. The service was sincere and fantastic. As far as we could tell, they do everything on their menu well. We ordered the recommended beef tartare & enjoyed how fresh and lightly spiced it was - the grilled toasts were a nice vessel for the appetizer. The burrata was very nice & creamy. I had a d ty aged \xa0ribeye medium rare at 12oz's - kind of over-ordered there and should have shared the portion! I'm not the most discerning with steaks so while it was good, it wasn't uniquely memorable to me even for a dry-aged. We ordered the risotto to share as a side and this one really stood out to us. We were particularly curious about the baked Alaska, a steakhouse classic but sort of outdated dessert. Elisa gave it a nice update with the hazelnut ice cream, breaded crust, and meringue charred to perfection. Like the addition of nut butter and bananas and brittle. Be prepared to spend $$$$$"", 'Some of the best steak I have ever had. Harvest was an amazing host as well and had great recommendations!', 'Elisa is my go to restaurant in Vancouver! It is a beautiful space, with delicious food and cocktails. The service is always outstanding!', ""Elisa was one of my favorite restaurants in Vancouver! I came for appetizers, drinks, and dessert by the bar and it was fantastic.1/ Food was superb - I ordered the burrata and bison tartare and both were excellent (5/5). The burrata is super fresh and better than what I've had at super authentic $$$$ restaurants in the US. The desserts (Baked Alaska, donuts) were also really delicious but not executed at the same caliber as their appetizers (4/5).2/ Drinks are really good! I ordered three cocktails that the bartender put together after I shared a few lines on my preferences and they were really unique, beautiful, and fantastically executed. They have a huge menu as well - giant wine list and five page scotch menu.3/ Ambiance has got to be one of my favorites in the world - it's really classy and spacious.Prices are not bad either!"", ""Okay, So we finally did a date night at Elisa! We tried so many different things, if I reviewed them all I'd run out of space, so I'll keep this short(ish) and sweet! To start we had the Seafood Plateau which was a large ice tray with several different appetizers. All of which were very good, but the cured hamachi stole the show. The thin slices were perfectly seasoned and had a slight crunch with little pieces of soba, absolutely delicious! I wish I could explain is better, but HIGHLY recommend trying. For dinner we had the 8oz tenderloin and the 12oz ribeye. Both cooked very well, but the ribeye had way more flavour and basically melted in your mouth. It's a bit more expensive but worth the $$$ for sure. We also had the forged mushrooms and truffle Mac and cheese as sides. The sides were good, I just wish I could taste the truffle more... but I think that was cause the Mac was a bit over cooked.Overall, food was great, service was great, a bit expensive but awesome date/anniversary spot. 9/10.""]",positive

We can wait to try them again."", ""I love this place!!I love s'mores when we talk about favorite dessert and so my boyfriend and I had to check this place out when visiting Portland. The line can get pretty long since it is a small place but we had got there closer to closing time so the turnaround time for us was fairly quick.I love the display they have showing about 5-6 signature s'mores. It also helps not having a large variety to choose from, because too many options are overwhelming lol. We ordered The Original and their s'mores hot chocolate. Talk about a chocolate overload.

Girl Scouty if I do say so myself. The three people working had flannels and round glasses and incredible attitudes and this place was busy busy before 10pm on a Monday and they were just trooping through. I am a messy lady so I didn't want to order a whole s'more and eat it in my friends audi so I went with the gourmet hot chocolate. OH MY GOSH. While we were in line they told us that everything as far as ingredients are made from scratch. From the infused marshmellows to the chocolate ganache to the salted caramel to the whipped cream.

It feels like you\'re in Disneyland, but the Portland outdoor version of it. The s\'mores are as excellent as ever. Homemade marshmallows and a plethora of toppings like caramel, fudge, peanut butter, and more. The menu changes seasonally. Torch fired right in front of your eyes by a chatty employee. (Smoreista? Like barista but for s\'mores?) Coffee and chocolate drinks also available. My only complaint would be, since the s\'mores are roasted by torch to order, that the wait times can be long. With the small size of the store, it easily gets crowded when date night meets family outing. However, I understand they\'re going for a personal feel and it\'s an invite to slow down, enjoy the atmosphere, connect with the smoreista, and capture that campfire feel in the city.

We got -Caramel Mocha- This one was sandwiched between Cocoa Graham Crackers and had Salted Caramel Sauce over the Coffee infused Marshmallow. whisky Salted Caramel - This one had the more traditional graham Crackers again with salted caramel sauce and whiskey salted caramel marshmallows.Now to me they both tasted pretty same and lacked in novelty whatsoever .

"['Awesome service, we were given a 1 hour waiting time but it took about 5 minutes for a Hibachi table, it was a really fun experience, the chef was funny and knew what he was doing, and you could tell he enjoyed his job.

Moreover, it's more shocking still that I forgot that Kobe existed. I mean, it's a chain known for this style of cooking and yet I had an entire deer in the headlights sort of look until memory struck me.It started like this. I had a massive craving for steak, he had the bright idea of going to a hibachi place (to which I had to explain the difference between this and teppanyaki, but that's an entirely different story). I was fine with it as I enjoy this type of food and I knew it was a healthy compromise as I would get my so-called steak. That and who doesn't enjoy a free show where they make your dinner in front of you?The restaurant was not even ten minutes away from where we were staying, so off we went and from there we were attended and sat pretty quickly. I had just put my name down when I received the infamous text of our table being ready. Time to follow the waitress and sit down then. Given how quickly we were sat, I figured food would be just as quick, but we probably waited a good twenty minutes for our chef to arrive and begin cooking.Since this was teppanyaki, our entrees were accompanied by an onion soup and a salad with peanut dressing. The onion soup consisted of onions and mushrooms, essentially warming me up after the rainy weather outside. The salad with peanut dressing while fresh wasn't my cup of tea. I prefer ginger dressing and wish that the salad had come with that instead.For my entree, I, of course, got my steak in the form of well-done sirloin. I went all out though and got shrimp, too. He ordered rare filet mignon. I don't need to tell you that the chef looked at me as if I committed blasphemy, even jokingly saying to me that my steak would be ready the following day. I was whatever and took it in stride, but I really don't think it's anyone's business how I like my steak.As far as I'm concerned, if I'm a paying customer, I can choose my food however I see fit. If someone doesn't agree with it, fine, but they don't need to comment on it. That rubbed me the wrong way. Yes, I'm aware that many great cooks have the opinion that well-done steak is a crime against humanity, but I don't need to hear it from them. Obviously if I'm in my 30s, you know that by this time I already know. Rolls eyes.This aside, the entrees came with massive helpings of fried rice and noodles. There was also a side of vegetables, but that was minimal. Overall, it was carb overload, and meh, while tasty, I don't think I need to tell you that we chose to focus on the meat and leave the rest. After all, it just didn't make sense as we knew we were in Orlando for a limited time and that there were other places to dine at. Not to mention that we didn't realize where the mini fridge and microwave were until the end of our stay, but that's a story for another day."", ""I definitely was surprised by the bill! I understand that the chefs are performers and truly make the experience... but if that's part of the experience then make it part of the transparent pricing! Don't add gratuity of 18% (for 3 people) so I get a bill for $60+ on a $38 priced menu item! I did have a drink, but that was also expensive...at 3pm in the afternoon. The food was standard hibachi fare, not cooked particularly well nor was it poorly done. I am just unhappy about the value for the money and about the lack of transparent pricing.

The atmosphere is awesome from the coy fish in the lobby to the mood lighting at dinner. \xa0We went for dinner with a party of 3 walk in and they were about to seat us within 10 minutes. I do suggest making reservations on the weekends and high tourist times. They have a sushi bar as well as hibachi grill. It is always a TON of food. One meal could be enough for 2 people, but they do not allow entrees to be split.Like all hibachi grills you are sat at a table with other people. I know it is not favorable in current times. However, they do a great job at leaving spaces between parties and I did notice some of the tables had dividers. They provide hand sanitizer upon entering as well. They have great parking behind the restaurant with dedicated spots for the restaurant.

"['Love the look and vibes of this restaurant. Tall ceilings with rock and roll decor all the way up and music videos playing. A mixture of large tables with high chairs and short tables and booths on the inside, and the outside had couches and fire pits as well.Cocktail drinks were okay, there was a large assortment of beers that they\'re probably better known to serve. The pretzel is probably the softest I\'ve ever had- it was amazing. The cheese sauce was kind of basic and I was hoping for a bigger punch of flavor so I would skip that, but the mustard on the side was very spicy. It was probably made with horseradish, but it has that ""sinus kick"" that you get when eating wasabi. My Cuban was decent, nice flat crispy Cuban bread and the usual fillings were good too. The fries could have been crispier and needed some salt (there wasn\'t any on the table either) but they were still good regardless.The service here was A+ very attentive servers and super nice.', 'We used to frequent this place quite a bit before having a kid and COVID, always loved it. The vibe, food, beer, service always a good time. We decided to go last night with our 1 year old and it was a disappointment.  I know business are suffering right now with lack of workers and such, so I get it. They were pretty steady and got more busy as the time went on and it looked like they had a good amount of people working the floor. In any case our waitress was still busy and slow to get drinks. Our pretzel with beer cheese came out fast and it was to be expected. A big hot soft pretzel with a mustard and beer cheese. Mustard was really good, beer cheese was a flavorless lumpy glob. Our meals took a bit but that\'s ok. However our drinks were getting low and no waitress or refills were around. I ordered the kids chicken fingers for my son, husband got the Sweet Heat Fried Chicken and I got the Steak Sandwich. In the past they offered a really tasty Tri Tip sandwich that I always ordered but it\'s no longer on the menu. They replaced uo with the steak sandwich. Steak, cheese, onions, peppers and garlic mayo. Basically a Philly.. I was excited to get it and my excitement for it quickly dissipated when it was placed in front of me. Just buy looking at it I knew it wasn\'t going to be good. The meat was grey and burned in some spots and I just knew it was dry. I gave it a chance and took a bite. Terrible. The steak was dry, flavorless (unless you ate a burned spot) and had the texture of shoe leather. The cheese was like glue and it was just awful. Fries were good. I was really thirsty and needed more to drink as did my son but I couldn\'t get the waitress. She would walk by the table and say ""everything looking good?"" and be gone before we could answer. Just frustrating. I didn\'t finish my meal nor did I complain because I didn\'t want to wait for anything else and I just felt bad. A floor manager saw us struggling at the end with a toddler that was wanting to take of running and offered to close us out. That was really nice of her.

We had a larger group (9 people), but we were still seated quickly and service remained friendly and quick despite the restaurant being busy on account of the holiday. Parker was our server and he was very friendly and attentive during our meal. I chose to try the California Cobb salad and a cup of their Bayou Gumbo soup. My boyfriend ordered a medium R&B pizza which is topped with pepperoni, sausage, black olives, and normally onions, but he got it without those so I could sample it haha. The Bayou Gumbo was tasty and I found it filling even for just a cup. It had a lot of flavor and a good consistency. I also enjoyed my salad. It was a huge portion and loaded with avocado, egg, blue cheese, chicken, and bacon. I did feel the chicken itself could benefit from some more seasoning to give it more of a pop of flavor, but it was still a yummy salad. My boyfriend enjoyed his pizza and the bites I tasted of it were really yummy. I'd easily share a pizza there in the future. All of our other party members seemed happy with their food as well. Overall, this is a cool spot with an awesome atmosphere if you enjoy music and music related art. With friendly service and tasty food with a variety of choices, I'd definitely return in the future."", ""Server was also a bartender and spent more time on the bar than concerned about tables. I also asked him to wait to put order in and he said he would put a hold on it. Halfway through my Gumbo the food came. He came over and said how's everything I told him the hold didn't work and he said I put a 5 minute hold on the order so I guess I was expected to eat a bowl of gumbo in 5 minutes not happening. Very disappointed"", ""We came in with a party of six about 4:00pm. Wasn't busy at all, so we got there at a good time. Ordered the big pretzel, calamari and the jalapeño poppers for the table. All of the appetizers were delicious! The entrées were a different story. The filet mignon I ordered was supposed to be medium rare-it got to the table medium well and was well done by the time I cut in the middle. Two people got the steak tacos---the steak was so overcooked, it was like eating jerky. We did let the server (Kinsey) know and the manager comped us for the steak and the tacos, so that was appreciated. Kinsey had a bit of a salty attitude and checked on us minimally, so I was not impressed with the service, considering it wasn't that busy. I would probably go again but would only get appetizers and not sit in Kinsey's section."", ""I hardly go out and when I do there is very limited places to decide to eat at. One of my homes is close to this location and I must say, it's refreshing to see a place that still cherishes the history of Rock'n'roll.I had no idea this place existed, only because a friend wanted to go to another place two doors down but this place of the three had to most cars parked outside. It's located in an unlikely place for an establishment like this but I like it. It looks clean, the staff still wear masks, I have not seen the bathrooms in this place so I could not tell you if they are clean. It has a lot of open air space for you to enjoy a meal outside and the inside is very spacious and adorned with various photos of rock legends as well as TV's that play (you guessed it) rock n roll.Your best bet for starter is their Bruschetta, took some home to my family and ended up having to order another one it was so good to them. Their drinks are mixed fairly well but not exactly. When offered a drink they as if you want a double. A double in your head is 2 ounces of alcohol but you actually are getting served 1 1/2.I am not a bartender but I've dated many and I sat there watch drinks get made with the 1 1/2 jigger. Seems to be industry standard but. \u200d Matter of fact, I was having a Saturday afternoon meeting with a woman who's sole purpose is seeing where restaurants can improve. And we just happened to be at the bar watching. It's a great place and they have various table setups for any number of guests. People are friendly that work here, make eye contact and are professional.I would recommend this place to people. I have to go back and try the rest of the menu though. It does have a family oriented vibe to it."", ""Solid experience recently at this location. We have been here a handful of times now. Our most recent visit had a larger number of persons because some of my family is in town for spring break. Unfortunately they do not have any large low top tables inside that seat a larger number, so we sat outside, which was a touch warm, but they do have fans and it is covered, which was nice! My parents are older and cannot do high-top table seating. They have both regular menus and QR code menus, depending on which you prefer. It was Sunday, so they were also offering a brunch menu. The fish sticks is my usual go to here, but the burgers are very good, too! Staff was very friendly and helpful throughout. She kept a good eye on us and kept drinks filled and plates cleared off when done. We love getting the Purple Rain dessert and of course did this at the end of this visit too. Overall: ASolid visit. Wish they had more low top table seating inside, but it's all good! Get the Purple Rain!"", 'A nice after work spot. I have come here a few times and have really enjoyed myself. It is a very fun environment to stop by during lunch or after work. They have great drink specials and pretty good food. The Bavarian pretzel was huge and pretty good. The beer cheese was a great compliment. The sweet heat fried chicken is honestly where it is at. The gravy is mouth watering. It is some of the best friend chicken I have had. VERY flavorful and cooked well. Stay away from the wings. I tried the sweet and spicy Asian and was pretty disappointed. They wings were pretty dry and just not flavorful. Overall, a great place to check out.']",positive
"[""I've been to this yummy place several times now. Today I brought my husband to try their chicken fried steak. He is connoisseur of chicken fried steak! This one was hand breaded and perfectly fried. The gravy was creamy and tasty. He got perfectly cooked over medium eggs.I had the ham steak with to over easy eggs. I love the hey I'm here. Very tender. I appreciate that it is not overly smoked and flavor. My eggs were cooked perfectly over easy as well. I also like that toast that accompanies the meal. Homemade bread is the best. I got the rye this time. Yummy! We also purchased a bread pudding. It was huge with yummy sauce. Large serving so we took it with us to eat later on!The service here is always spot on. Prompt and courteous. Lots of refills on my coffee which is key! I checked with Us several times to make sure everything was OK. That is rare these days.I recommend Sonny's and bring my friends and family here. See you next time!"", ""I've lived in Portland for over 12 years. I've eaten at pretty much every brunch spot. We recently moved out to the deep SE and just randomly walked into Sunny's. To be honest I just expected it to be the same old hum drum greasy spoon spot and boy was I wrong. This place is special. It's all from scratch. Everything. They have the best sourdough I've ever had....cuz it's made and makes IN HOUSE! Who does that!??!??! The hash browns and fresh grated and you can tell from the first bite. THEY'RE BAKING PIE SIZED CINNAMON ROLES FOR GODS SAKE! AND THEY'RE PHENOMENAL! Amazing portion sizes and extremely reasonable price. I'm looking forward to eating every single thing off this menu over the coming months. Sunny's! Don't ever change!"", 'I had the mushroom omelette with hash browns and toast. \xa0Be prepared that all the dishes can be ordered ""big"" or ""bigger"". I was only able to eat half. Great breakfast if you are ever in the area.', ""Service was good but I do not recommend this place. It baked it's own bread and cinnamon rolls so it seems like it would be a restaurant with good food but it is not. I tried every dish that our party of 6 ordered and there was something wrong with each of them. The cinnamon roll was tough, like it had been heated in a microwave, the toast was dense, the hot chocolate tasted like Swiss Miss instant, the pancakes were like cardboard, the corned beef was over cooked and hard to chew and the silverware was the cheapest I've ever eaten with... heavy duty plastic ware would have been better. I had high hopes and I hate writing bad reviews but if you go here, just lower your expectations."", ""Welcome to Sunny's Diner, where the portions are HUGE! We came for brunch on a weekday, and while the place wasn't full, there was definitely a constant flow of folks coming and going. I ordered the French toast combo, made on their homemade cinnamon loaf. Mmmm. I subtracted a star for no fresh strawberries, though it is January, and is my fault for not asking. We'll definitely be back."", 'Pleasantly surprised by this cute little diner! Retro farmhouse with a charming and personable staff. The food was decent, the homemade \xa0bread amazing, and the drinks were impressive - albeit a little weak.', ""The key word in the name is diner. this is americana, flowered oil cloth on the tables, as you sit the waitress asks if you want coffee. they pack a lot into this menu, breakfast on one side lunch on the other--many, many choices. I was craving a burger, which at Sunny's means a B.U.M.B (big ugly messy burger--but you can see from the picture it's big (1/2 # patty) but not ugly, while the three well-used napkins that were on the table when i finished confirm the messy.) Was tempted by the original version (bacon, ham, egg) but was happy i went for the more unique reuben version, with a good chunky layer of stringy corned beef and just enough sauerkraut. I've noted eating overloaded sandwiches elsewhere that the buns usually do not survive, but this one, made in-house (as are bread & cinnamon rolls) stayed intact while also being tasty. Ordinary looking fries but perfectly crisp. Very friendly service. Old school's not always a bad thng. And the prices are very reasonable."", ""A wonderful diner on the big bleak street that is the Avenue of Roses. Sunny's has great homemade food, enormous portions, good coffee, kind and attentive service-pretty much they hit all the sweet spots for a perfect diner experience. Usually we go for breakfast, but lunch is also available & the sandwiches we've ordered have been darn good."", ""Came here on weekday morning for a breakfast. Be prepared to wait. Can't blame them at all because one guy was carrying the whole restaurant. He was host, waiter, bus boy, to go orders. Kudos to you dude. I'm seriously so appreciative of that man.This was also one of the few places in Portland that I saw offers plant based chorizo. I ordered a delicious scramble with the soy chorizo. Hit the spot. Was everything I wanted. And what a steal! Great prices.Highly highly recommend."", ""This place is phenomenal!!! We came on a Sunday morning for brunch and of course there was a little bit of a wait but it wasn't too bad.. 15ish minutes at around 10:30am. The place is funky and cute with lots for the eyes to admire. The food is insane! In taste and in portion. I couldn't believe the value here. Your buck goes very far with these meals. I was able to make two meals out of my corned beef hash. Loved that the bread is all homemade and you can tell. The sourdough is thick and fresh. Only critique I had was that I wished there was more corned beef on my plate. The potatoes were plentiful which sort of drowned out the succulent beef. Otherwise, a great brunch spot. Can't wait to come back and try out the cinnamon roll!""]",positive
"[""I want to start this review off with saying I really never take the time to write a review unless the place is extraordinary in some way. My girlfriend and I decided to try this place out last night (Thursday) for dinner. We are relatively new to Portland and are always looking for new places to try out. Honestly, although the food has always been amazing, most restaurants in the city are far below what I would call the golden standard as far as serving goes. Having said that, this place was great!We were able to get a nice table for two immediately and within a short minute were greeted by Emily. She was so attentive (but not overly so) and friendly. She gave good insight on the food questions we had regarding the menu and brought out each item in perfect timing. We did not try any of the drinks on account of the bottle of wine we brought, which came with a $15 corkage fee (a pretty standard price in my opinion). We started off with the Baguette and butter which is without a doubt some of the best tasting bread I have had! So warm and crisp and their butter was made in house. For entrees we shared the kale squash salad and the santa fe chicken burger. Now, I don't know what it was about last night, but I can say without a doubt, it was the best salad I have ever had. The minute my girlfriend and I bit into it, we ceased all conversation until every inch of the plate was clean. Now, i'm sure this was not the healthiest option but who cares!? The chicken burger was so savory and rich and we got duck fat fries with it. I must say though, it tasted a lot more like a burger than chicken, but maybe it was ground chicken? \xa0 Finished off the whole night with a shared glass of fernet and their Whiskey Mousse dessert which I highly recommend. The whole staff was amazing that night. The bartender was very friendly and Emily was fantastic. All in all, this night was a success and we will definitely be back!"", ""2.7 weeknight dinner. Hm.. How'd we get such inattentive service, but other tables closer to the window were given quite opposite? Was it because we were going to drink at PDX City Grill and didn't order alcohol? Cuz-- gulp-- we were Asian?Food was just alright. Lot that is left desiring. Sog and overpriced dishes-- our soup was not too tasty.Our dining experience left us not desiring a second try for them to redeem themselves ( i.e. No oyster in the oyster bisque)"", ""Portland Dining Month review: This is fine-dining cuisine in a bar setting. The courses are a little slow to come out, but they advise you upfront it will take about 1 1/2 hours.1st course: dandelion greens with poached pear and house-smoked blue cheese is a nice balance of bitterness and sweet2nd course: -lobster pot pie is covered by a glorious dome of puff pastry. Inside is a lobster soup/bisque. It's runny, although this is not necessarily bad. There is a generous portion of perfectly-cooked lobster.-steak option is sliced wagyu medium-rare and tender. It seems like the bone marrow was removed and served in a shell on top of the bone, which was filled with a braised beef that was on the salty side.3rd course:Frozen chocolate mousse with cocoa shell is smooth and creamy served with a piece of honeycomb and honey/bourbon liquid.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with the high end quality of food. It's obvious the chefs put a lot of thought and attention into each dish. It's definitely not your average bar fare!"", 'Really impressive food - unexpectedly impressive. \xa0The prices might be a tad high, but it is Alberta - and prices are going up accordingly with the popularity. \xa0I\'m just not a fan of whiskey, yet I know this is the namesake. \xa0Not my thing, so can\'t rate it. \xa0I ordered mac and cheese thinking, ""oh it\'ll be small, so I\'ll order a salad too"". \xa0Big mistake, HUGE. \xa0The mac and cheese in itself is a thing of beauty, flavor, and epic portions...as was the salad.No complaints here, other than it gets quite loud the more packed it gets. \xa0So, get there early for dinner, get your drink on, and then the noise won\'t bother you as much.', 'The food looked really good but it is a bit on the expensive side. That said, I stuck with a $8 whiskey on the rocks and drank my dinner while my 11 other friends ate dinner. I find it perfectly acceptable to add a 18% gratuity on a large table tab but I do have a problem with them adding a 20% tip and then making us figure out the bill. We had 12 people; most who had a couple drinks. That meant spending 20 minutes trying to figure out our bill. 20% to me means the server figures out the bill. Heck! Most places only charge 18% and they figure out the bill. On a positive note, they did let us pay with separate cards. That was time wasted that we could have spent driving downtown where we were finishing our night.', ""So glad I finally hit up this neighborhood spot. Crazy good food, and awesome service. Two of us got share plates:- grilled Caesar (added Chicken)- duck fat fries- stuffed dates- garlicky greensThe grilled Caesar with chicken was amazing! We thought about adding an entree and didn't need to with that. That could've been a meal on its own. Plus the duck fat fries which were crazy delish (def add the lemon). Dates were good, but unnecessary and garlicky greens were pointless (chard with garlic for $9? Not necessary). Awesome, attentive service with good recommendations, and a decent wine list (no whiskey here!)"", 'My favorite place to go after going to a show at the Alberta Rose theater. Bartender and wait staff is always friendly. Food is excellent and made with fresh ingredients. One of my favorites is the mac and cheese and the cheese board. I especially love their long list of whiskeys and scotches. Inside looks great nice wood theme decor and big windows to people watch and hang out. Overall I would come here again.', ""Whiskey bar... he whole vibe is very cool ambience is mellow, there are a couple tables everywhere pretty small tables but you could definitely bunch them together to fit a larger group. We came after dinner so we really just came for drinks and we got the duck fries. We met a couple who were actually there for dinner and they said they go there all the time and they really love the menu.The drink menu is pretty big so I took a second to kind of take it all in. But there are lots of whiskey drinks, obviously, and they're also drinks I don't have whiskey. There aren't many without whiskey but there are some. They make this orange slushy with whiskey in it I'm not sure what the exact name is however it is AMAZING. I'm sure if you'd asked the bartender somebody would know exactly what you're talking about.Not the cheapest place but it's kind of swanky so it's worth it. The staff are also really nice so just come and hang out."", ""I really, really want to like this place but I received one of the most terrible service experiences in recent memory the other night. I have gone here on three occasions; one experience was fantastic, one was mediocre and one was so terrible I left before even ordering a drink. I live a two minute walk away from this place and it is incredibly convenient, but I have found myself walking further to a more sub par place just because I know I'll get service immediately. I will give credit where credit is due, because I still do want to give Branch another chance and it's true that there is huge potential here. Their happy hour is awesome for one, and is ranked as one of the best in Portland (I believe it was the Mercury that said that). It only lasts from 5PM to 6PM, but their drinks and food are marked down significantly and it's all high quality stuff. Definitely no complaints there. The ambiance is also very nice, and it's a great place to take a date. Their whiskey and scotch selection is one of the best I've seen in Portland, and it's all fairly priced.The service, while normally very friendly was not acceptable the last time I came here. The wait staff looked overwhelmed and rushed, yet the place was not terribly busy. I sat down at the bar, waited over fifteen minutes for service and eventually left. Not even an acknowledgement or an apology for the slow service, and I ended up going to another one of the many bars that Alberta Street has to offer, where I was served immediately upon entering. Also, the music was played WAY too high during my last visit. I actually invited someone for drinks here, but I told them to go somewhere else because I could barely hear anything outside of the music. I will return to Branch when I use their $12 for $20 deal here on Yelp and give them another chance. I will update my review when this happens, to reflect if it was just a bad night or if there is something more serious going on."", 'I think I\'ve been coming here since it opened. As we had our little one, I wasn\'t able to come as often. They have a great selection of whiskey and my memory still smiles at their steak.However, I will no longer step foot in this establishment. In fact, I walked out after paying my bill the last time and walked over to another place to eat because the tenor of the place has changed so much. You see, they demand that you eat the menu items exactly as listed on the menu. Have an allergy? too bad. Lactose intolerant? also, too bad. In the most recent case, I didn\'t want an undercooked egg on my food. You know, one that I could get a food borne illness from. I requested that it either be cooked or not included on my meal. The request was declined. This place isn\'t Beast. I\'m here to enjoy whiskey and have some food. Of course I inquired about the policy and was told that the chef felt that I could either take it or leave it. That was enough for me. I left it, not to come back. Apparently I wasn\'t the only one who has asked about this ridiculousness but yet it continues. I also mentioned it at the next establishment and they also confirmed they\'ve had new business because of surprised (almost) patrons of Branch. Let me know when I don\'t have to risk a foodborne illness to eat here. I don\'t care what the chef\'s ""vision"" is.']",positive
"['Love at first bite with this Triple Black Garlic Ramen and Chicken Karaage from Koika! Cha-shu and egg are seasoned well. The triple black garlic oil soup base is so flavourful, especially with crispy garlic chips. Thin hard noodle, bamboo shoot, spinach, and seaweed complete this wonderful texture and flavour medley.Chicken Karaage is more like strips than chunks, covered with sauce and sesame seeds. Batter is crispy and the meat is juicy. The sauce is delicious, though I would suggest to ask for it on the side for takeout, so to not affect the batter texture and be able to adjust saltiness to your own taste.', ""This ramen spot has a new seasonal menu that I've decided to come check out. I ordered two items from the seasonal menu and one ramen from their regular menu. There are no patio seating for this restaurant. They have a big U-shaped counter table that runs along the kitchen, a wall and the window. Not sure how many seating they're offering with distancing in place. They have a few tables spaced out but nothing set for party size above 4. I sat near the back and noticed there isn't much ventilation or perhaps they haven't turn on their air conditioning yet. It wasn't a super hot day and the ramen I had wasn't piping hot (more about that!) so for me was bearable. From the seasonal menu, I had the Triple Black Mazesoba and Deep fried chicken tsukemen. \xa0The mazesoba came with this gorgeous onsen egg. Once all the ingredients were mixed, I could see and taste the base of the sauce is mostly seaweed. There is no soup for this noodle. I was expecting the noodles to be thicker but it wasn't. The meats, cubes of deep fried pork and marinated beef, added some really nice flavors. The way I have read it on IG and their menu, it would be a very garlicky dish but it wasn't at all. And the dish came lukewarm which wasn't as issue for me.Next the tsukemen is a dipping noodles with broth on the side. This dish had my favorite thicker noodles. The deep fried chicken was done really well, 2 decent sized pieces but you might be expecting more for $17. The broth is supposed to be piping hot to make up for the noodles which were (again) lukewarm. It was just hot enough but as you dip noodles in, it cooled down rather quickly. The broth had a good portion of marinated stewed beef and made it really tasty but it almost feels like two dishes with the fried chicken added as afterthought. The ramen we ordered from the regular menu was the seafood ramen. It came beautifully presented with crab, clams and mussels. After eating through it all, there wasn't much 'meat' in the crab. The soup base have strong tomato flavors in it. Finally, I almost forgot about the puri puri prawn tempura. They were the appetizer and it was really well done. Nice thick panko crusted batter and a the drizzle of tartar sauce was perfect. This review is more 3.5 than 4 to be honest. But their dishes do have more pros than cons and the cons for me weren't 'deal breakers'. It was all very edible and I left feeling very full with leftovers too."", 'This place NEVER fails! I am a little obsessed! I used to work in the area and would routinely have lunch here. There was one time that I came here three times in a row for lunch. Now I drive halfway across the city to eat here!Their Kimchi ramen is phenomenal. The broth is rich, not too spicy, and has a slight smoky flavour. The shredded pork on top is always tender and a little salty but pairs perfectly with the flavours of the broth. I highly recommend coming to Ramen Koika because they will never disappoint!', ""*3.5 stars*Good ramen spot along Davie! The ambience was alright, great service, but what really caught my eye was the Humble Prince ramen and the karaage. Although it's not the first place I would think of for ramen, it satisfied my ramen craving! The portion size was more than enough, but I found that the spicy option was lacking in heat.

It was busy but not full house. Good service. The broth was rich with flavour and not too greasy. Will come back again', 'The server is kind and food also good! Especially, i usually enjoy the Tsukemen and shiho ramen', 'I remember the first time I came here I was brought by a friend who just loves ramen, for me I have the thought of here we go again, as the influx of this Japanese noodle in the downtown core, the question really was, ""what makes this one different""? I can say that not all ramen joints are the same, and yet luckily this one stays away what I deem \'Ramen Alley\' (lower Robson). One thing from my original visit to my most recent one was not having the usual tonkatsu broth that seems to be lurking around everywhere... no, this place carries a varied assortment to tickle those tastebuds from chicken broth, pork broth, miso, and if you really want the tonkatsu, but do not think that this is only a soup only ramen joint, when you go through the menu there is a lot more if you are not feeling the soup varietal.On my last visit, I had the chance to try a few more dishes to really get the difference of ramen broths that this place serves up. Starting with regular chicken broth ramen, a very clean take, one where you are brought back to something more simple, and definitely something that only another place that is near \'ramen alley\' is really advertising as what they do, well... Koika does it too, and they do an extremely good job of it. You can really taste the chicken flavour, and wonder how long those bones have been simmering in the pot to get such a pure taste. Mixed with the freshly house made ramen, and this dish could definitely be one of those Vancouver rainy day bowls while sitting by the window watching the day go by.The next bowl I was able to dip my chopsticks in was the black garlic oil ramen, I have had this before, during my first visit, and revisiting this bowl again it was definitely my favorite, and still is due to that black garlic oil that they use, it is hard to describe but there is a slight bitterness at the end of every slurp which does not allow the taste to linger too long which clears the palate for you to prepare to dive into the next bite. With the mixture of slurping this beautiful broth with the perfectly cooked strands of ramen, this is my \'go-to\' and it\'s not for everyone, especially if you are having a close business meeting later and you don\'t want to spread your garlic breath around, but do not deny yourself this bowl.The Nagasaki Champon seafood ramen was another bowl that was very different from the two above, with a mixture of pork broth, and a bunch of prawns, scallops, mussels, and even Thai chili\'s floating in this bowl, this was more a meal on it\'s own, and aside from the excellent presentation, anyone who is looking for a mass serving of seafood and noodles, this is your bowl. There is a bit of kick from the chili\'s but nothing over-powering, even the pork broth was light, not to take anything away from the seafood in this bowl.The King\'s ramen was another bowl that I had a chance of having, and if you are one who likes a mish-mash of not the regular cha-shu, but instead a pulled pork variety with fishcake and bamboo shoots, bring your stomach, cause I could compare this with the Nagasaki in size, there is a lot here, from all I had to eat I could see the appeal of this bowl, as it is very balanced, from broth, to noodles, to toppings, think of this as a salad of stuff in a bowl.To close off this meal we had their yaki-soba, and when this dish came out steam was just flying up while the bonito flakes were dancing just telling you to take a dip into these noodles. This was another treat, as something that you wouldn\'t think of ordering at any normal ramen joint, the noodles were stir fried perfectly where they didn\'t overpower this thing with soy sauce, and the meat slices were tiny to combine into every bite while you wrapped your chopsticks doing a different kind of slurp without any soup.I almost forgot about the homemade gyoza, where you knew these weren\'t bought at some frozen vendor as each bite was meaty, with a meaty uneven texture where you could tell the meat filling was put through a grinder, and it was confirmed by the owner after talking to him. The natural fats ooze out of each bite of these dumplings, and yet the wrappings are not overly thick, yet not too thin where they hold up their own, especially with the caramelization of the dumplings when brought to us was a sight to behold.Coming in here, this place has a very casual easy feel, a place where you could either come with a friend, or if you are alone, you would have a comfortable good time sitting near the open kitchen concept and if you are lucky, watch while things get prepared from scratch. Just because this one is not located in \'ramen alley\' don\'t turn your back on it, they have quite a bit more than just a normal ramen shop and after being able to see even a ramen making machine, and watching the tv showing the cooking competition that the people who work here go through, and eventually are judged by owner who learned his craft in Japan... this place cares about what you are getting!', 'We ordered Koyu-Ka Tsukemen. It was love at first bite. It took me back to Mitaka, Japan- where I always ordered tsukemen at this one ramen shop that is the BEST in that neighborhood. This place does it justice. It makes me happy. We will be back before we leave Vancouver.']",negative
"['I appreciate Bijou and their workers all wearing masks inside while they prepare our food. They are considerate of those around them. Their artwork outside their place is beautiful in these times, a beautiful reminder that the only way forward is a united community. But that being said, it helps that the food is AMAZING. We had a cheddar omelette with mushrooms and a breakfast burrito. I wish I had a bigger stomach. \xa0Great work guys, keep feeding us!', ""Meh. That's how I feel. This is not a destination brunch spot. This is the brunch spot you go to when the other 2 spots across the street are full. We chose Bijou Cafe because it looked cute via other reviewers photos. However, I was unimpressed. I had their special omelette with pork and apple. The pork was literally just sliced deli-meat style and did not meld well. My husband had french toast and agreed it was just ok. While our server was very friendly, he wasn't terribly attentive. I had to flag him down to get refills on my coffee and water. There are many good reviews, so it's possible our day was just an outlier but I'm not interested in returning."", ""It was Saturday morning and we just woke up and wanted some brunch! We were still jet legged and got up earlier then planned. Luckily this place opened at 8am so we got there 10 mins after 8. We were greeted warmly by the waiter. He told us our specials and got our drinks out to us right away. I decided to go with something on the brunch menu you never really see. The fried oyster hash. My friend got this sweet potato hash with pork belly. Both came out around the same time. My fried oyster hash was pretty delicious but also super oily. There was a lot of potatoes/onions/bacon bits which made the plate extra delish! After awhile I was getting full so I decided to just eat the fried oysters (since that's what I'm really paying for). Delish but oily lol."", ""Ooo, Bijou Cafe is boujee! Before departing from our weekend trip to Portland, we hit up Bijou Cafe for some brunch. I wasn't expecting it to be so hipster and more upscale than most brunch spots, but that's what we got! The place is super cute, bright, and airy. Really fits that Instagram blogger aesthetic if that's what you're looking for.On to the stuff that matters. Service! The service was fantastic. We had a super nice guy who was very attentive and helpful. I don't remember his name, sadly. For food, my husband got the Biscuits & Gravy and I tried the Farmer's Omelette. Our server warned me that the egg was cooked a bit differently than a traditional omelette and more like the French style... I was scared, but I tried it.100% should've got the biscuits & gravy. Tried a bite of my husband's and it was soooo good. I wasn't a huge fan of the omelette. The texture if very runny/watery and pretty much cancels out the taste of any cheese. That being said, he did warn me and I should've moved on to something else on the menu. If I were to return to Bijou I'd definitely love to try what else they have to offer."", ""Maybe the best omelette I've ever eaten! It's French styled so it's nice and soft in the middle and just perfectly cooked on the outside. This is how an omelette should be. It goes great with the amazing aardvark sauces too. Also got a mimosa that was half grapefruit and half orange as recommended by our waiter. We got there around noon, put our name down, and went nextdoor to stumptown because we thought there was a long wait. Turned out it wasn't even a long wait and they called our name while we were waiting in the huge stumptown line. No worries though, they seated us immediately once we got back! I definitely recommend this place if you're staying downtown!"", ""Famished from an early morning flight and foodless trek across the country, our party was looking for sustenance and some breakfast goodness. It was like hungry o' clock and we were starving for it.We fired up the Yelp app, and Bijou lured us in from the airport. Parking that early was a painless experience and there were lots of spots. We got to the front door just in time for them to open and we were the first ones through the door.The Yelps told me the oyster omelet was the thing to get, and I don't argue with the Yelps. An oyster omelet newbie, I have nothing to compare it to, except to say that these people know their way around a French omelet (I prefer this style to the regular American kind) and it was good. I probably preferred the farmer omelet, but that's a personal preference.I found it to be reasonably priced; they're not giving it away but the space is night and bright and airy and someone has to pay rent. Worth it. Breakfast achieved."", ""BEST BRUNCH IN PORTLAND.So good, in fact, WE HAD OUR WEDDING RECEPTION HERE.Oh, did you know they do private events? Now you do!Did you know they only serve fresh maple syrup with their delicious, fluffy pancakes?Do you know they serve this amazing red paper jam with the griddle cake and fried chicken? Did you know you can't find a more perfect omelet in the entire PNW?They have an Illy coffee cold brew machine.They have a menu that can't be beat.

Actually leaning towards boring \xa0 The bread chosen was a baguette. Hard to slice with with a bread knife. The jam was TASTY"", ""I loved our dining experience here. There were just good vibes all around from the kind and friendly staff to the chefs you see cooking your food to the ambiance and decor (contemporary, yet still a neighborhood cafe). Bijou just felt comfortable and cozy and I'd come here every day if I could. The breakfast and lunch menu has a nice variety of options for those who want a rich and hearty meal to those who want a light and healthier option. My husband ordered the Fried Chicken and Griddle Cake, which made my mouth salivate even though neither are part of my current diet. He loved every bit of it and said it was one of the best he's had in a while. I went with a small Mixed Green Salad, Roasted Chicken a la carte, and Pinto Beans a la carte. The dressing was simple, yet perfect with olive oil, lemon, and sea salt. The Chicken was served cold and provided me with some good protein. And the Pinto Beans were nice and hot with a mild kick of spice. We will definitely come back here whenever we're in the area."", 'There are many fine places here in Portland that offer brunch. After having tried quite a few of them, Bijou Cafe is currently my favorite.  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Bijou Cafe has been in business at the same location since 1978.

Everything is made from scratch using traditional French style cooking techniques. They use local, organic food whenever possible and everything is very fresh.

"[""If there's any restaurant in Chinatown that deserves style points, it's Double Chin. They have old favorites (Beef Chow Fun), play-on old favorites (Char Siu Pineapple Bun), random fusion dishes (Kimchi Alfredo), and dishes that purely confuse (Double Chinwich???).On pure taste, Double Chin is pretty good. The later in the evening you go, the better the food seems to taste - they're open until 4am Fridays and Saturdays. For a late night snack, I recommend the HK French Toast. It's filling, sweet, shareable, and just SCREAMS decadence."", 'I would give 3.5 stars. Double Chin is THE place to go after the clubs and night life closes in Boston. Food I\'ve tried:- The menu is quite extensive, and there a surprising number of fusion foods. I do appreciate their creativity in their menu!- WATERMELON BOMBER ($34): a classic scorpion bowl served in a watermelon. The alcohol is deceptively hidden in the sweetness of the drink, so proceed with caution. Overall, not to sweet and quite refreshing. - SKILLET LOBSTER ""MAC"" N CHEESE ($16): the cheese is pretty thick and gooey. I didn\'t really taste the lobster part too much. Flavor wise is pretty standard for mac n cheese. - SCALLION PANCAKE ($8): it is crispy, with enough thickness to have the chewiness. It tastes like a standard scallion pancake. - STIR FRIED SHIN RAMEN ($11): I liked the presentation of having the ramen cup come with the dish. Flavor wise, it is exactly as advertised, shin ramen stir fried with veggies. I did appreciate that the veggies were not overly cooked and they retained their crunchiness.- WOK CHARRED GARLICKY BOK CHOY ($10): you can never go wrong with bok choy. The sauce is very garlicky, and the bok choy soaks it all up. There is a greasy component as well since it is stir fried in oil, so I wouldn\'t exactly call this a healthy option. However, it is still delicious. \xa0- SRIRACHA HONEY POPCORN CHICKEN ($8): the meat was on the drier side. There was a balance of sweetness and the spiciness, though I did not find this to be spicy at all. Personally, I thought it could have had a touch more sweetness. - Overall, I felt that the flavors were ok. I was more excited about the prospect of getting the food and the envisioned flavors that were described in the menu, than the actual moment of eating the food. Atmosphere:- Since this becomes the hang out area for those enjoying the night life, it can get pretty rambunctious during the peak hours of Friday, Saturday after midnight. This is also the only time I have been here, so I cannot really comment on how the atmosphere would be during their regular business hours.Service:- The staff is pretty accommodating to large groups.Overall:- I appreciate the innovation of the menu, but the flavors were ok. Nothing ever tastes bad, but the flavors are never as I had imagined them to be. - Would I visit for the food during regular business hours? Probably not. Will this continue to be the go to place after a night out in Boston? Definitely.', ""There aren't many places in Chinatown open after an evening show, and this time we chose to go to Double Chin. \xa0I'm glad we did! \xa0It really hit the spot. \xa0Though it took a bit of time to get the waiter's attention, the food came out super quickly and we were in and out in around 35 minutes. \xa0Rice rolls in XO Sauce ($14) - this was definitely a highlight. \xa0Super tender and chewy rice rolls pan-fried to perfection with delicious marinade and fresh bean sprouts. \xa0Couldn't ask for anything more!Pork and shrimp wonton noodle soup ($10) - Nice and thin egg noodles, comforting warm soup, and well-cooked and plentiful yu choy. \xa0The wontons were okay -- definitely big, not much shrimp, mostly pork. \xa0Pretty good deal and very filling -- didn't realize it would come with so many vegetables which we appreciated!Crispy chili chicken ($13) - The flavors here were good (love the chilis, savoriness), but the chicken left something to be desired. \xa0It was a bit tough and the coating was more of a tapioca or potato starch and not particularly crispy. \xa0Still a yummy dish!Overall I was pleasantly surprised by the offerings at Double Chin. \xa0The rice rolls were perfect and I really enjoyed everything else too. \xa0It'll be a tossup between Taiwan Cafe and Double Chin next time I'm in Chinatown at night!"", ""Awesome! Was here tonight with a few friends and the service absolutely made the meal. I sadly didn't catch her name, but the waitress working tonight (with IMPECCABLE EYELASHES might I add) was beyond friendly and helpful with the menu. Constantly checked on us, offered advice, and even subbed out my drink when it wasn't to my liking. Not super loud, and pretty chill ambiance for a Friday night. If nothing else, come here for the staff and the booze. Super creative drinks, and the boozy boba is to die for."", 'Eating at Double Chin is truly an experience!! I first found out about the restaurant through the Fung Bros\' youtube videos on hidden gems in Boston chinatown. When I first saw Double Chin appear, I thought ""hmm, I\'ve never heard of the store"" but upon hearing Gloria, the owner, speak about the store and her aspirations with it, I was moved by how she wished to connect her American and Asian roots and bring tasty foods from her childhood onto an actual restaurant menu. It was about representation and shining light on this bicultural identity, and I really identified with that passion of theirs as a Chinese-American as well and wanted to support that. I first came a few weeks ago, bringing 2 other friends. We already had so many foods from the menu that we wanted to try and came prepared! However, showing up, the menu had so many MORE enticing items that we just couldn\'t leave without trying. We ended up leaving with 7 dishes total for us 3 along with a BIG cube toast and boba drinks...and boy, we were so full but we just had to go full out and try everything we did. We later came back again a week or 2 ago. There are many popular fusion spots in big cities that appear nice and aesthetic but don\'t really deliver. However, this spot in particular, the food looks nice AND tastes good!! Everything was enjoyable. I really enjoyed the uniqueness of how certain menu items combined different Asian and American ingredients. My favorites were probably the Elote fried rice and the Skillet mac n cheese with the rice noodles! Both just had such addicting flavors, it was hard to stop eating either of them, even when I was full. I probably wouldn\'t get the shin ramyun noodles or peking duck fries again personally! For drinks, the capri fun SPF 60 was really tasty, and I\'m not normally an alcoholic drinker. Another fun part was that my group and I even got to converse w/ the owner Gloria for a while, who shared with us her goals in designing and creating Double Chin, and she was so lovely to speak with!Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience there. It was such a fun time, and the workers and owner there are so nice! On one hand, I feel like they have the potential to be so big but on another hand, I secretly also like having Double Chin as a secret hangout spot that I don\'t want overly crowded...I will for sure be back often and raving about the place!!', ""We checked out Double Chin and left a little disappointed. I was hoping that this punny little spot would be my new late night go to. Double Chin is a pun because it's named for the two owners Emily and Gloria Chin AND one could get a double chin eating like this daily. We got there early because we expected a dinner rush and we were right. We arrived at 5:30pm and by the time we left at 7:00pm the restaurant was full of millennial aged patrons.We got the Shin Ramen Stirfry, the Peking Duck Fries (with just a smidge of Peking duck), Satay Noodles (not photographed) and the Macaron Madness. The noodles and fries were just as expected and definitely IG worthy as promised. There was nothing special of note as far as flavours were concerned. The Macaron Madness cube toast didn't disappoint with its Instagram worthiness but it did fall short on flavour. The batter used had that overpowering eggy taste (think sulphur) that one doesn't expect from a well done French toast batter and the taste of the oil from the deep fryer was overly evident (they might want to change the oil pronto). The service was slow and it appeared that they forgot part of our order as the bill was placed on our table before we got the item. It was only when we asked if the item was still on its way did it arrive 10 minutes later after some hubbub at the register. \xa0We sat for about 30 minutes waiting for it overall. All of the other items came within 10 minutes of ordering them. If you're looking for a trendy, Instagram worthy spot, this is definitely for you. We were not impressed but will give another try in a few months. Hopefully we won't feel then that we paid a hefty price for IG photos rather than a meal worth the listed price points."", ""Last night I needed something quick and was craving Chinese food and everything in Chinatown was closed besides this place. I ordered the lobster fried rice and added shrimp. I got home ready to chow down and the rice looked and tasted bland and flavorless. I did not see any lobster meat in the rice either. The rice had a strange taste that I could not put my finger but I've never had lobster/shrimp fried rice that tasted like that before. It addition to the strange taste, the rice tasted like it was mixed with dirt. It was very gritty and sandy. I couldn't eat the rest of it and I ended up tossing it. My sister had a similar dish and did not like her food so I definitely would not recommend this place."", ""My friends and I stopped by here after bar hopping. I always wanted to try this place out and love that it's open until 4am on Fridays and Saturdays. My group was slightly larger so the staff took some time to arrange the tables for us. Some of the tasty items that were ordered included the Lobster Rangoons, Calamari, and Shrimp Fried rice. The prices were a lil high and I believe we had to spend a minimum per person, but it was worth it after a long night out."", ""THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! Great service and wonderful drinks. I'd highly recommend Double Chin for an evening out with some great friends."", ""Stopped by this cute fusion cafe for a quick lunch while in town and had a good experience! The menu is pretty large so it took me and my dining partner a while to decide on what to order but we were happy with our choices. We ordered Poutine Your Mouth and Spicy Rice Cakes to share. The poutine is crispy waffle fries with a cheese sauce, kimchi, and furikake sprinkled on top. These were good and the flavors complimented each other really well. I feel like the sauce could be spread more evenly but the fries are great on their own as well so I can't be mad at it lol The rice cakes were SO good. They were fried so they were slightly crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. They put mozzarella cheese \xa0and thinly sliced Chinese sausage on top which went really well with the sauce. I do wish there was a little more sausage but overall this was a really good dish! We didn't try any of the desserts but I'll definitely come back for those. This is a good place for a quick snack or meal and they're open fairly late if you want a late bite. Check them out if you're in the area!""]",negative

We ordered the wagyu beef pepper fried rice with egg which was really good! We got the split dumplings (half chicken half pork) the skin was nice a crispy. Hubby got a small steak to try.

We drove by on our way to another restaurant but decided to pop in. Flashback to Tokyo's Ikanari came to mind except it's not, but has some similarities. When you enter, \xa0line up and place your order before you sit down. I ordered spicy beef on rice and my son ordered the curry chicken rice. Ten minutes later our meals arrive sizzling on a hot plate. The rice is in the middle of the hot plate surrounded by raw meat. Don't get discouraged, the plates are sooo hot you won't be able to eat your meal right away anyways. It also comes with a paper collar that keeps the sizzle from hitting you and your clothes, which is helpful but they could be even taller. All you have to do is mix the meat around a little then toss with the rice, wait a few minutes then dig in! Careful not to touch the hot plate. The spicy beef was excellent, spicy but not crazy hot. The curry was a very flavourful yellow curry.

Fast forward to another day, we were looking for a quick late dinner (after 8pm) and thought of them. I checked online and it turns out they\'re a popular franchise from Asia that has expanded to Canada- and more importantly I saw they sold a lot of meat (yum!). I called and they said, no wait time, and yes high chair. Perfect, off we went.The restaurant was pretty new and clean. It had a fastfood feel with kind of a fastfood price. Some dishes looked like a good deal while some steaks were priced $30+, which I couldn\'t justify paying for a quick eat and run.

It seems like you pay 10 dollars for a burger that costs 5 at five guys or shake shack. It\'s grown on me because the food is good, even if the value is abysmal. Also, the atmosphere is good and they have great fries.I\'ll start with the good. I come here occasionally just because i live close by... The crinkle cut fried are somehow amazing. I didn\'t realize it was possible to have above average crinkle cut fries until I came here. Right mix of crunchy exterior to soft interior. Also, i love how they serve beer in a soft drink cup. Finally, the location/vibes are good. It\'s a fun place to go if you are in the area. They really commit to the pool theme. Now the bad. My main issue is that price point is just not worth it under almost any circumstances. The burgers are good. Definitely better than macdonalds. Probably better than 5 guys. That being said why is a flat top burger 10 dollars? Is it because you they have Austin ""wagyu""? I guarantee you could not tell the difference between their patties and standard ground beef from HEB. Is it because they have brioche buns? A regular potato roll would basically be the same...Also, very limited selection for such a boughie place. They don\'t have cheese fries? If you ask they\'ll sell you beer cheese instead. Not worth it. Also how do you have beer cheese but not cheese fries? Just melt the cheese from the burgers on top! Also, 2 types of beer on tap. Also, one is coors. I love coors, but why are you selling me that with a 10 dollar burger??Also, one caveat to the theme is that sitting inside is weird.

Overall a nice pool side hangout!"", 'This place is kitschy enough for people to love. Anyone getting casual grub or drinks in beach/swim wear would love this place for what it aspires to be.What does suck though is a bit hard to ignore. And so here are the main three:1) Overpriced small portions.2) Overpriced tiny-sized drinks - made much more reasonable at half-priced happy hour that is for only three drinks in the menu (no food).3) Not much of a table service despite them asking for 20% automatic gratuity being added to the tip if you keep an open tab (even when it\'s not crowded and in the daytime) - this is not charged if you don\'t keep an open tab.4) Subpar food. Their thin meat patties were overly salted - extremely salty - and if you get anything with buns (which aren\'t made from scratch), the ones I received were on the dry, stale side - and at $10 a pop, without any sides being included, it was a big disappointment.As for the overall flavor of the meal, it was average at best. Not bad, but not great either. Even some finer establishments that I had been to had better burgers for the same price, and included a side. We tried the All American burger and the Loco Moco, a Hawaiian heavy-dish specialty consisting of garlic rice, fried egg, gravy, and a hamburger patty. Their rendition of the loco moco included mushroom gravy as well as the untraditional jalapeños (can\'t be in Texas without these, I guess), and being much less than a large platter that is typically seen in Hawaii. For a better Loco Moco, I was told to try L&L in San Antonio (yes, quite a drive - but thought I\'d share).The ""famous"" Hurricane did pack a strong punch, but it was too tiny to justify for the regular price of $10. At the happy hour pricing of $5, I\'d be fine with it. However, I don\'t see this place as a place to hang out for the bar - there\'s too many good bars in town, some with better specials, or better sized drinks, and also with A/C to not deal with the summer heat.So no, I would not come back here, unfortunately - this place seems to prioritizes being a bar over being a restaurant or cafe. And the bar is not quite reasonable either, for local Austinites, in my opinion. Without some needed upgrades, I don\'t expect this place to stay around long, and not even with the tourist dollars considering that there\'s not many tourists that come to this part of town.']",negative

The wine is well-selected for the food, and we got good advice about it.Mostly, I'm writing this review because the service was everything I hope for. Fanny Bay clearly put resources into giving its staff the training they need to do their jobs well. Both our waiter and the person who brought our food knew the oysters--they could not only identify which oyster is which, they could recommend oysters based on preferences, and say why--and they knew about when other things appear on the menu. Also, our waiter was just... a great waiter. He made it seem like the day was better than it had been. He was also either there when we wanted him or easy to find, gave us time when we weren't ready, and answered questions when we weren't sure.You can get oysters cheaper, but the prices reflect the service (and selection and standards).

They were well shucked, cleaned and eaten. Fresh as can be, creamy and flavorful. The service here is also great. Very attentive and knowledgeable. I'm a beer lover and usually don't drink beer with seafood but the server suggested a great beer on tap that paired well with the oysters - Phillips lager. It didn't accentuate fishy flavors in the oysters or maybe the fanny bays were so fresh they didn't have any fishy after taste? Try and let me know.We liked this place so much for happy hour appetizers that we came the next day as well!"", ""We're big fans of Fanny Bay oysters but have never been to their downtown location. We dropped in on a Sunday (with 7:15pm reservations) and were immediately informed about the hour and 45 minute seating limited. Not sure why because they weren't busy. Service was very lacklustre and almost unwelcoming.Menu consists of raw bar, to share, entrees, sides and desserts. They had about 14 types of oysters available. Happy hour (3:00pm to 6:00pm daily) seems to be the best bang for your buck with \xa0snacks (including $1.75 feature oysters) and drinks. - 9x Oysters ($3.50 each) - we tried the sun seeker (Okeover, BC), kumamoto (Chapman Cove, WA) and northern belle (one of their east coast features). The oysters were fresh. Easily the best thing we ordered. The freshly grated horseradish was excellent.- Fanny Bay paella ($27.00) - don't expect a traditional paella. This one has garlic scapes, baby tomatoes, green and red peppers. Not very rich or flavourful. You don't get very much seafood either. The fish was overcooked. You get a grand total of one tiny scallop. Prawns were the best thing from this dish. - Mussels & clams ($25.00) - we opted for the spicy fennel/basil sauce and added fries ($3.00). Shocking that this doesn't come with bread. The sauce had a nice kick. A couple nice plump mussels.- Poke bowl ($24.00) - my buddy enjoyed it; soba was cool and refreshing. He liked the juicy prawns. One thing it needed was a sauce.Decent eats but I'd only likely return at happy hour."", ""From the venue, to the service, to the food that we ordered, everything was fantastic! The best restaurant my friends and I have been to so far! If you come to downtown Vancouver, this is a place you have to go to during happy hour: 3-5pm. Park on the underground across or on the street. Just trust me and order what I ordered, you'll enjoy your mid day meal!"", 'Came yesterday for Happy Hour with 2 other friends. They do not accept reservations at happy hour so first come first serve. We waited about 45 minutes for a table. Vaccine passports and IDs were checked before entering. Services and food were great. The ambiance was relaxing and a mixed of clientele from hipsters to seniors. We sat near the oyster bar so could see the staff shucking the oysters. We enjoyed all the items we ordered except for the paella which we felt was on the wetter side so more like a risotto. Featured Oysters, Brussel Sprouts, Fish Tacos and Sablefish Collars were all delicious. My favourite was the Sablefish Collars with a delicious sweet and savoury coating and the meat so also so moist. The Fanny Bay Shooter a must to start or finish the happy hour afternoon. A wonderful afternoon with friends and will certainly be back again.', ""Came here for a quick bite during happy hour with my boyfriend and our puppy ! We sat on the patio & ordered a couple of apps and oysters to share - all were from the happy hour menu.Brussels Sprouts | These we're prepared well and crispy but it was just missing a bit more seasoning, still good but wouldn't order againDeep Fried Pickles | These were good pickles and a perfect light breading with a really good dip ! Definitely a must order if you love pickles like me ! Oysters | Ordered half a dozen of each of the happy hour oysters both were very good and super fresh""]",positive

We lined up at 5pm right when they opened as we didn't have reservations. They couldn't have been more sweet and accommodating even with the popularity of their restaurant coupled with such a busy holiday. We ordered hot sake and miso soup to start. For dinner we had Soft Shell Crab roll, Spider Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, and smoked salmon. All were crazy delish. Impeccable service from our waitress and all for well under $100.

This place is def family friend and has an easy going environment. Our waiter was prompt and and we got our food in a petty timely manner although the place was packed.

The dynamite roll was our favorite - def give it a try! Also Hana is located in the Japanese Marketplace on Kenny Rd so make sure you check out the other places as well!', ""We were seated right away and I was impressed with how clean the place is. For hospitality they serve you with a heated towel to wash your hands.We ordered four sushi rolls: tempura, spicy tuna, an avocado tuna roll and a California roll. The colors didn't look very bright, but maybe it's the lighting. The taste was good.I ordered the breaded pork over rice and it comes with miso soup. It was ok. I would have liked the breading to be crispier.I do recommend this place."", ""Delicious sushi. Easily one of the top in Columbus. Fresh fish and rice was perfectly cooked and sticky. I'd say they have some unique options in comparison to a lot of other places roll wise. Loved the pixie roll! Mango was perfectly ripe. Some really nice wine options.It was pretty busy for a Friday I'd say. Service wasn't so great. Very friendly staff but SLOW. It didn't seem like they were understaffed, but I'm not sure. Food did come out earlier than we were told it would (45 mins) but we weren't checked on after that and were looking for our waitress for quite awhile trying to get our check. Overall we enjoyed our experience. We weren't in a rush. I'd go back!"", ""This is probably my second or third time visiting this restaurant. It is a place that many people in Columbus rave about when recommending a sushi place. And it is typically always packed. But I would say that it is not a vegetarian friendly place. They had a handful of vegetarian sushi options but apart from that majority of their entrée items were not vegetarian. Even if they did not actually contain meat some of the sauces they use contained clam or other animal products. So unfortunately it was very difficult for me to order. But our server was very helpful and went through several of the entrée options to help customize an order for me. I ended up going with a tempura vegetable fry, sushi and tofu. It had also been a while since I had sake so I went with an order of that as well. I greatly appreciated the service that I had in the restaurant and we received our food in a timely manner. But I do not plan to is it the restaurant in the future due to the lack of vegetarian items. Being an Asian restaurant a would assume they would have more options because I haven't had A problem in the past ordering at Asian restaurants. But I would say it's a great option for meat eaters"", ""We came here on a Sunday night and it was very busy! The host was friendly when seating us. My husband and I had never been so we wanted to indulge a bit so we ordered and ate wayyyyy more than we should've. We got the akai Hana box which is served with soup or salad and mochi desert as well, the explosion roll it has shrimp on the inside with scallops and spicy Mayo on top, and the party boat for 2-3 people. The food was very good! I personally think it's a bit overpriced but definitely worth trying. The only stuff we didn't like was items we personally just tried and didn't enjoy; not how they were made. Kitchen had a long wait time on food even with our reservations and the service was mediocre. We thanked the kitchen staff when we left and got ignored (usually it's the other way around) and we had to wait around 20 mins for server to bring check while she was cleaning."", ""Kids running around, Karen's loud and not taking care of their rug rats!

"[""Wow. Just woww. This place is amazing, from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave. Immediately when we walked in, we were greeted with very loud and warm Japanese greetings. The entire staff is extremely friendly and polite and the atmosphere was perfect. The restaurant is noisy, but we loved it! Good ambiance, good music, great service & incredible food. Everything, and I mean everything we ordered was AMAZING. The funny thing is that we were actually trying to get into another Japanese restaurant however their wait time was too long so we stumbled across this gem and were not disappointed at all! In fact, we were pleasantly surprised. We entire place was packed so we were seated at the bar and we didn't mind at all. I love being able to watch all the food being made.We ordered beef tataki, chicken karage, spicy calamari and from their specials menu we ordered scallops & bacon. I really like how each of our tapas came in staggered times so we were able to eat them all fresh, right after they were cooked. The beef tataki was very tender and came with a generous portion size. The chicken karage came with 5 huge pieces cooked to perfection. The calamari was absolutely delectable & those scallops were so freaking good. The service is also very fast. Our water cups were never empty and out empty plates were taken away immediately. When you leave, you receive a very warm Japanese farewell from the staff. Will definitely come back to this restaurant when we visit Vancouver again!!"", ""One of our favorite traditions in Vancouver! The warm, fast service and awesome staff with traditional greetings and farewells, extensive izakaya menu and menu specials all haven't changed throughout the years. We love the beef tongue, ebi-mayo and yaki-udon. On our most recent visit (Christmas 2021), menu specials included your choice trio of appetizer selections for $14 CAD. The sliced jellyfish on chilled tofu was super tasty and umami and the spicy bamboo and kelp brought back childhood memories. Skip the wait by making reservations! Food is worth the wait though, if you come here on a whim, just know seating is cozy. Love the staff at this location, service is fantastic!"", ""Pretty good! I don't think I'd go out if my way to come here but the food was tasty and unique.

We ordered BBQ Beef Teishoku Combo ($12.80) and Sashi Tei ($16.80) \xa0they were tasty. I really liked Sashi Tei it came with tuna, salmon, spot prawn and scallop sashimi with Rice, soup and salad. It was tasty and filling. BBQ Beef was good as well just that rice didn't taste good according to H.It was a good dining experience. Waiting time wasn't too long. Price was reasonable."", ""Didn't have the loveliest experience here. We were sat by the door and someone was smoking on the bench right outside the door so whenever the front door opened we got a huge waft of the smoke.

Dishes I recommend: EVERYTHING!!Things I usually order: daily special, sashimi trio, kabocha korokke, yakiudon, kimchi fried rice, ebi mayo, salmon yukke, beef carpaccio, black cod saikyo yaki (only available sometimes)', ""It was around 9pm on Thursday night after we finished our massage appointment in downtown, we thought it wouldn't be so packed because it closes at 10pm. But, all tables were still unexpectedly taken and we needed to wait for 5 minutes, so I guess the dinner menu should be more attractive than lunch menu since we usually went there for lunch before.We were quite hungry so it didn't take too long for us to decide what to eat. We ordered diced hanger beef steak, steamed mussels and BBQ eel on rice. We initially wanted to order black cod and okonomiyaki yakisoba but they were already sold out, probably because it was late already.. lolThe first dish came to us was the hanger beef steak, the steak was so tender but we both thought the seasoning was too strong for us. If the seasoning was a bit less and not so marinated, I think it would be better. It was a busy night so it took another 10-15 minutes for other 2 dishes to arrive. The BBQ eel rice surprisingly tasted quite good, it came with scrambled egg underneath the diced eel. When I mixed all together, the scrambled egg and moist eel made the whole texture balanced and I couldn't stop refill in my bowl! I definitely pick this from the menu next time again if I don't see any other choices. The steamed mussels were not bad, but I guess the mussels were frozen type because we couldn't taste much flavor, which was what we expected. The broth was even better than the mussels itself. The mussel tasted better when we put the mussel in a spoon of the broth. Overall, all the dishes we ordered were quite good, but I guess it would be better if the diced hanger beef steak came to the last since the other dishes tended to be less seasoning and less flavor. If the first dish tasted too strong, it would cover the taste from the other.Not to mention how fair the prices are, and how nice the service is, I highly recommend everyone to visit this restaurant, no matter for lunch or dinner!"", 'Always enjoy my time at guu! The food is always consistently great and delicious. We came during happy hour (everyday 2-5pm). We ordered the edamame ($4), 3 pieces of chicken kaarage ($5), 6 pieces of ebi mayo ($9) and a very delicious lychee lychee cocktail ($5) with soho, vodka and lychee juice. We also ordered a few more items off their special dinner menu, including the salmon aburi. This dish was very fresh and refreshing with a citrusy carrot sauce. The grilled squid legs and takoyaki were also very appetizing. Overall a great meal!', ""Wow, just wow. This place looks just like any other regular izakaya but don't let that fool you. Food here is top notch, and so are the staff. I'd say that everyone was very friendly, energetic and inviting.We ordered from the regular menu and the daily special menu. From the special menu we got the aburi salmon on rice and the BBQ eel rice. The rest of the dishes were from the regular menu. These include: smoked monkfish liver, Takowasabi, karaage, takoyaki, and ikamaru (grilled squid). For dessert we ordered the mochi ice cream. The aburi salmon was fantastic. It was plated beautifully. The salmon looked overdone but in fact, it was lightly torched. This in combination with the vinegary sushi rice was delicious. You have to drizzle some of the soy based sauce that they provide. It was an umami rich experience. The BBQ eel rice was hands down the best I had ever eaten. They serve it on a bed of rice along with some fluffy scrambled eggs. This dish is super rich. I'm glad they added the pickled ginger to garnish. You will savor every bite with how buttery the eel and egg are. This was my first time having monkfish liver. I really enjoyed the sweet and sour vinegar dressing the liver was placed in. The liver is soft and has a fatty flavour to it. It's really nice! The takowasabi and takoyaki were pretty solid as well. I highly recommend their grilled squid and chicken karaage. The squid was tender and \xa0just melts in your mouth, while the karaage was super crunchy and savoury. To finish things off we had the mochi ice cream. This was a huge portion. We had scoops of green tea ice cream with red bean, mochi pieces, and topped with whipped cream! I love how refreshing it was. We sat right by the bar, so our chef actually prepared all our foods right before our eyes. Everything came out quick, and with a smile. Not to mention how fair prices are too.

When we arrived there was a line but I didn\'t mind! We waited about 15 min and were able to snag a table.First glance at the menu it\'s predominately seafood based. Makes sense. But meatballs were listed as an app! When our waiter came over we ordered some garlic bread to start and I inquired about the meatballs. He was honest and said ""you don\'t want that"" so I scrapped that idea and settled for linguine with calamari. My bf got the linguine with shrimp. The garlic bread was SO garlicky in the best possible way. It was simple and yet so tasty. I recommend saving a few pieces to dip into your past sauce.Now my main dish I was really disappointed by. The calamari was all clumped together and very chewy. It also tasted SUPER fishy. I drowned it in some fresh cheese and ate it because I felt bad sending it back. Now my boyfriends dish? SO good. A great balance of flavors and the shrimp was perfectly cooked.I\'d come back for sure but maybe get something else. I do highly recommend the garlic bread and that linguine with shrimp!', ""To be honest, I'm not sure what the hype is all about.

Nothing unique but also nothing bad about it.The lobster ravioli is what this place seems to be known for so we ordered it! First, there's only 8 pieces of ravioli that come with it and second, the taste of the ravioli is pretty bland.

I felt this gritty sandy texture when I bit into the seafood (I think it was mostly from the clams, but it could've been the mussels too... not entirely sure). This kind of ruined the dish for me to be honest.Overall, I don't know if this place is worth all the hype. I mean the food and service were fine (minus the sand in my dish, which other Yelpers have also pointed out), but it wasn't anything extraordinary. Maybe my expectations were too high. I might give them another chance and order something without seafood if I ever come back.FYI They are cash only.""]",positive
"[""Pleased with the quality of food my party and I got at Seiza! \xa0I've always walked past it on Main Street and wanted to come by to check it out. \xa0My friend came here for a birthday party and was able to reserve the long table for 10 people a week beforehand. \xa0The food is somewhat fairly priced, more in the higher range, but you still get portion size for the amount you pay. \xa0For example, 2 people in my party got the Seiza Sukiyaki Hot Pot for $40 and it looked like you could feed the whole table with it. \xa0The spider crab roll was so delicious and well worth the $14.80, with the ample soft shell crab pieces in it. Staff were polite and patient in managing our big table, and checked vaccination status upon entry. \xa0Some instruction on how to get the full experience out of the Hitsumabushi for example would be great for people that aren't foodies, or knowing what sets the Chirashi dons apart.Tip is added to the receipt for big groups!"", 'Good restaurant- nice servers and good food.However,menu selection is a bit too large.

I have walked by Seiza multiple times and finally decided to try it out after watching a TikTok video about the Aburi cake. Although the menu is more on the pricier side, I assure you that it is definitely worth the money. From the moment we entered to the moment we left, I had no complaints whatsoever. The menu offering is also very vast with pages and pages of items to choose from. Everything tasted fresh and clean and oh so yummy! The plating of the dishes was also beautifully done and the whole shop just emitted a very peaceful yet elegant vibe.

I had this place bookmarked for a long time and I finally got a chance to try it out recently. We ordered:-2 Gen Mai Cha: This is tea. I really like the flavor of the tea. Definitely high quality tea-Unagi Oshizushi: definitely a super nice flavor. I did find the rice a bit soft making it difficult to hold the sushi together when picking it up-Tuna Sockeye Salmon Don: Too less tuna and salmon. There was a lot of rice and the rice didn't have the right balance of vinegar in it. Also the rice was a bit overcooked or hard. -Miso Soup-Spinach Gomaae: Nice flavor-Spicy Chicken Karaage: B really liked this chicken. The chicken was very tender. Also he really liked the spiciness level.-Four Winds Brewing PINT: B said he never had this beer and wanted to try it. He said it was good and had lots of flavor. THe beer was sweet and citric with a fair bit of hoppiness.The food was very tasty. Service was good. We came during the pandemic. The restaurant has sanitizer set up at each table. As well they ensure that social distancing is in place. Overall, the food was good but not yet wow. The tuna sockeye salmon don was somewhat disappointing. Everything else was good. The price is also pricier than many Japanese restaurants in the area."", ""With the high ratings on Yelp, we had high expectations of Seiza but unfortunately was quite disappointed. It seems like they tried to serve everything and anything Japanese food related and we were a bit overwhelmed with their 30 page menu with multiple chapters. Our server had to come by twice before we were even finished going through the menu once. With trying to diversify, it means that they don't have one particular speciality and it showed. We got the cold udon and found it a bit odd that they added ice cubes to the sauce which actually ended up diluting the taste. We also got the salmon oshi and found that it fell apart quite easily and wasn't pressed together as tightly as it should have been. It was priced at Miku/Minami prices without the same quality. We also got one of their special rolls and for what it was, found it overpriced as we were still hungry even after ordering our standard number of items. Overall it was okay but for the price, I would probably recommend going elsewhere depending on what type of Japanese food you were interested in. They also charged a $1 extra for hot tea."", ""for my best buddy's birthday, his wife arranged for us to dine at this new japanese restaurant in the mt pleasant area. The interior looks really modern and their dedication to following proper covid protocol was very admirable. Surroundings were very clean and staff was allWearing masks.

Moving on, for appys, we tried the shrimp aburi sushi, then tried the sexy salmon sushi/roll, lobster roll, and the Millie-feuille pork don. Now dont be misled by the french sounding name...( i was ....lol) . Turns out, it just pork katsudon. Lol. The sexy salmon sushi/roll was a thing of perfection. The fish was so fresh and of high quality. The dish practically melts In your mouth. Each bite was such a culinary experience. So rich and moist, with the fish roe \xa0complimenting the dish perfectly. The shrimp aburi sushi was executed just perfectly. Shrimp was torched beautifully, the shrimp fresh, and the rice just amount of stickiness. The lobster roll's presentation was awesome. Complete with an actual lobster tail. So the gist here is, the rolls have lobster tempura in them. The dis was amazing, as it even included hot lobster tempura pieces on the side to complete the dish. However, the lobster tempura inside the rolls were no longer crispy when i had my first bite. The lobster's start power did not shine thru from within the rolls. But the sauce and salmon toppingOn it, simply amazing! I am a huge fan of katsudon....been eating it since i was a teen, and even studied with a japanese chef on howTo make it. \xa0Now the secret to the dish it the sauce..hands-down! Without a good sauce to simmer the onions, egg, and pork cutlet, the entire dish falls apart. The katsudon at seiza nailed the sauce 100%. It had the right amount of kikoman and sugar content, as well as the key ingredient - Mirin. \xa0Normally this dish is served with a cover for the bowl, mine came without one.

Everything was a bit colder by the time I went to get it and returned home but overall, it was all good! The soft shell crab was a decent portion and tasty. Takoyaki had that hit of ginger that you don't always get and the nabeyaki udon was a good sized portion. Tuna bites were tempura fried tuna with a spicy sauce and again, there were quite a few large pieces of battered tuna!

Everything was cooked beautifully and was buttery and flavorful altogether. This is a neighborhood and local favorite, with many people celebrating various occasions here! Lots of great cocktails and desserts too - only wish my stomach were more of a bottomless pit so I could try EVERYTHING.One of the only things stopping me from giving 5 stars: Service / cleanliness could have been better. Someone walked us to our indoor table though we confirmed that we would have an outdoor table in our reservation, and said outdoor reservations were all full for the next month. Curious, but fine, I ignored it - next, we noticed our small plates were still quite dirty with oily remnants on them, so I asked for two new ones. Our waiter took them, apologized because there are apparently some new dishwashers starting out, walked away, and brought them back - turns out all he did was wipe them with a towel, so now they were just oily streaks instead of oily splatters. I didn't say anything further because at this point I could see cleanliness was not a major worry for them - the table we sat at was also quite sticky / oily. All in all, our server was nice but cleanliness is a huge sticking point for me and it also didn't feel great that we couldn't get our original reservation.Overall, the food was good but not mindblowingly amazing - I would recommend for good vibes and happy hour, but maybe not a place for a nice dinner."", ""Warm, vibey spot for elevated Southern favorites!

Also tried some of the blackened redfish and slow cooked beef shoulder, and everything was executed well.The desserts may well have been my favorite part of the meal - both the chocolate truffle cake and bananas foster beignets (!) were addictingly decadent. Sadly, I was way too full from some good heavy Southern cooking and a pair of cocktails to really dig in.The one big knock against Salty Sow was that they enforced a somewhat bizarrely high table minimum on our party. We weren't in a private room or anything like that - in fact, we were seated at a long bench/picnic table style high top in the outdoor back patio, nearby several other tables. I think the minimum they told us was something like $60 per person?

The fries were good though they put an egg on top of it which was kind of weird to be honest and a little unnecessary. But the dipping sauce and seasoning on them was really unique and great. Honestly with all the meat smoke smell in there I was kind of shocked that they didn't serve things like brisket. There were times that the smoke was so strong that it was actually a little overwhelming unfortunately. Felt like I was sitting right next to an outdoor smoker cooking at the table.

This was our first experience here after always driving past this location but based off the quality of food, this will be our last. Not only did an ANT arrive on our food dish, our waitress showed no remorse after we brought it up. Besides that, let\'s talk about quality. The soup of the day bowl arrived messy, soup splashed everywhere and the flavor was extremely bland. The ahi tower presentation was decent but flavor was mediocre. The impossible burger? Not new to the amazing potential of this specific veggie patty but the one we ate here -dry dry dry. The description says mustard and garlic aioli but there was no sauce found anywhere on this burger. As for the stuffed salmon being their special? This one was an extreme disappointment. The rice pilaf tasted like burnt charcoal, the asparagus tasted like burnt charcoal and the salmon was raw! I get I ordered ahi as an appetizer but I ordered a hot plate of cooked salmon and had the minimum expectation of it being at least cooked thoroughly. After dissecting the salmon entirely (food was glistening like a raw salmon would when you buy it at the grocery store) we called the waitress over to show her and all she said was, ""we cook all our salmon dishes medium rare."" I have NEVER received a salmon plate of this poor quality and I\'m sorry but if that was the case, wouldn\'t it be common courtesy to ask how I\'d like it prepared? Moral of the story, the waitress did not reconcile this situation so that added more disappointment to this experience. We only ate 10% of the impossible burger and the salmon and the waitress didn\'t bother to ask us if we enjoyed it. We still tipped 20% because we understand how hard people work in the restaurant industry but this entire bill total was $75 and it felt like a waste of money.

Even with all of this I don\'t tip like the stereotype either and tipped 20% even though we were treated in this manner. \xa0My actions don\'t reflect how I\'m treated, they reflect my moral standing. \xa0Very sad...and would have hoped our experience would have been better.', 'We had lunch today and totally enjoyed.

I believe they made it from scratch, but the prepackaged ingredients (also to be expected) were just so evident.

I combined two fish bites in one taco with the veggies, and it was delicious. \xa0The Mahi -Mahi was flavorful. I was so disappointed that the one bites weren't more because they were so good.

It can be difficult to find consistency in the vegan world in Atlanta, but Harmony never disappoints! Since Covid, Harmony has closed indoor dining (not sure if this has recently changed), so we get it for carry-out!

Please have the original owners sell you their recipes and method of cooking. If you're a loyal customer to Harmony which I was you will quickly find that this is not the same as it once was. They changed the decor which was once warm and welcoming to a harshly lit place and it seems like a run of the mill hit or miss Chinese spot. And believe me...it is definitely a MISS.

"['I went to Cafeteria with two friends on a warm, sunny day. We got seats outside. It\'s a little bit crowded with lots of tables pushed together, but it was quite an enjoyable experience to sit in the sun and eat good food. Nevertheless, I\'ll try to separate my feelings about the weather and my feelings about Cafeteria in this review.The first thing that hits you about the restaurant is the menu. It\'s quite large with all sorts of good-tasting things, but the prices are really quite high. It\'s about $9 for an appetizer of tomato soup, $15 for a 12"" personal pizza, and $14 for a black bean burger. But the food is good. My two friends ordered black bean burgers, and they seemed quite pleased. The consistency of the burgers is ""mushy,"" but my friends framed the comment quite positively. I ordered a pizza with ""balsamic marinated Portabella mushrooms,"" truffle oil, arugula, and mozzarella. It was quite good, and is quite filling for the average person. I couldn\'t necessarily taste the portabella mushrooms nor the truffle oil, but I actually thought that the roasted garlic on the pizza was quite pleasing to eat. All the ingredients on the pizza were rather harmonious, and I enjoyed every slice. Aside from this awful name for a fairly upscale restaurant, Cafeteria is pretty impressive.* The prices are far too high, but it\'s understandable because of the real estate in this area. The service was excellent, and we really enjoyed ourselves. *Cafeteria serves ""cafeteria-style"" foods. But come on. Can\'t you choose a better name?', 'A few weeks ago, my friend and I went here for lunch. We shared the portabello and truffle oil pizza and the chicken parmesan. The pizza had portabello mushrooms, truffle oil, arugula, and mozzarella cheese. The pizza tasted good but I thought the dough was a bit chewy.The chicken parmesan consisted of a fried chicken breast topped with parmesan cheese and tomato sauce over spaghetti. I thought the chicken was a bit dry and the sauce was a bit sour.', 'I just had lunch/dinner at this place.The pizza was hard and they\'re so stingy on the cheese that the pizza should be called ""hard tomato sauce pizza""... C\'mon I work in the food business and I know that cheese isn\'t a big food cost. The same on the Fish Tacos, it comes with everything but fish, besides the Taco was very hard too. It looks like the food was ready there waiting to be served. Of course I notified the server about the quality of food (it\'s not the server\'s fault) but the kitchen and the owner should be notified about the bad quality of their food.', 'I stumbled upon this restaurant while I was on Newbury street. I love the outdoor patio -- unfortunately, did not get a seat. We opted to sit at the bar because the restaurant was packed. Dining at the bar was a tad bit uncomfortable because the bartender stood in front of us the entire time and tried to push us to order a drink. At some point, we gave in and ordered mimosas so the bartender could leave us alone! I ordered the cafeteria club sandwich, while my friend ordered the cafeteria burger. We both thought the sandwich and burger tasted average.', ""After reading plenty of mixed reviews, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a shot! Thursday evening - practically empty.

For dessert - brownie sundae :) Now here's why they got 3 stars. While we're chilling, eating dessert and finishing paying our bill - we saw a mouse running around. I was totally turned off after seeing that. We told our waiter so he could let his manager know but at that point, nothing else could be done. He did apologize several times. It was just unfortunate because we had a great experience up until that moment. Other than that, it would've been a 5 star review! We won't be going back though."", ""When you go to Cafeteria, you MUST get the \xa0cheeseburger spring rolls (5 stars) and the Slane Brew Cocktail. If you love fries, you'll enjoy the parmesan fries. The meatballs are just okay, the meatloaf sandwich was just okay (although I did order it on a gluten-free bun and we can all agree that GF bread is generally disgusting, but I took the bread off and the insides were just meh. Cafeteria doesn't have mocktails on the menu but their bar can make you one."", ""I've been dying to go here for the longest time and I am glad I finally got my butt here to try it out!! \xa0My friend and I came here for Saturday brunch and had such a pleasant experience here (as should brunch always be!!)We ordered calamari to start and were surprised at how generous the serving was! The calamari here is pretty solid--it's well seasoned and had a nice texture. We were already getting stuffed even before our main entrees came out (whoops), but for some reason we couldn't stop munching on it lol. For my entrée, I got the boston cream burger, which was pretty good. I found it to be super juicy and I liked the addition of the habanero-radish cream cheese on top for a bit of a unique spin on your classic burger. \xa0My friend enjoyed her sandwich and we both left as two super satisfied (and super full) customers!!Overall, Cafeteria is a cute brunch spot in newbury.

Got the spinach artichoke dip (kind of tangy and more of a puree--but wayyyy better than traditional dip!

It was also noticeably quite pale in color compared to other peanut sauces I've tried. My two orders of pho came with a extra large bag of bean sprouts, basil, jalapeño slice and lime! Yay! Also packed in there was 4 or 5 little tubs of chili oil sauce. Overall, these items I tried were good but average.

"['*updated review*It\'s been a year and I was lucky enough to bring a good friend who appreciates the finer things, be it good food or fantastic wine. CSW is still beautiful and I love the option of cozying up on one of their couches in the lounge. Very classy and tasteful! You will appreciate the detail in decorations at this lovely venue. Even the bathrooms are ""pretty"" with fun wine quotes. I don\'t remember on my previous visit if wine flights were an option, but they certainly are now!! My favorite kind of flight is a wine flight! Excellent choices and I enjoyed every single one they chose. It\'s a well thought out selection of wines from around the world and one of their own. I still really love CSW Merlot. It was excellent a year ago and still tantalized my tastebuds! There were also some lovely choices from the Okanagan and I believe Italy and France. You must try a flight. My friend enjoyed their Rose flight, but I am a red girl through and through. The menu has been updated as well. We enjoyed their prawn and pesto flatbread and popcorn. I was too busy savoring their flatbread to take a picture. This flavor combination has always been a favorite of mine and it\'s done very well at City. I highly recommend you give it a try. The popcorn is a hoot too, served in a massive jar mug, great for sharing. Service remains attentive and prompt and always with a smile. Happy hour is still at 4:30-6 with a late night hour after 10. Select wines for $6 and flatbreads for $8. Melody If you read this we are going for some HH!*original*I have been waiting for a chance to check this place out as I am a true born and bread wino! So naturally, I went with momz. Trust me mom is almost as cool as I am. CSW is located on 2nd Ave right across from the old, now closed, Sin Bin in Olympic Village. It was relatively easy to find with their happy hour menu displayed on the side walk. I do love me a good happy hour. I\'ll start here.... $2 off glasses of wine, $2 off 1/2 liters and $5 off bottles. The wines that were available ran from $10-15/glass. They also have $5 off their platters (which are crazy over priced but I\'ll get to that later) $2 off pizza. $5 off beer.This venue is quite lovely and decorated tastefully. Beautiful wood tables with 2 or 3 as long tasting tables and then about 5 smaller tables. There are also comfy chairs and coffee tables if you wanna kick it comfy style. That\'s how we did it! The bathrooms are decorated quite as nice but have entertaining wine quotes on the wall. Originally the plan was to attend a tasting with food pairing as a groupon my ma purchased. I made my reso online but apparently you have to call because they do large tasting events on specific days only. So that scraped that plan and we did the happy hour instead. We were given a free glass of the most amazing Prosecco I have ever had. It was so flavorful and creamy lol. I don\'t know how to explain it but if you love Champagne and can cough up the $55 for a bottle I highly recommend it. I\'m sure you can get a glass of it as well but I cannot remember. They have wine on tap as well but none of those were available and I forget why hahah. Maybe if I drank less wine I would remember more lmao!On to the wine review. First I tried the Semillon. I am more of a red girl but it was a nice white. Crisp and refreshing, not too sweet, a little dry. Next I had the Merlot which was from 2012. OMG!!! This was the best Merlot I have had in many moons! So good. So smooth and flavorful! Must try. Thirdly, I had the Cuvée. I have never tried a Cuvée before but this was tasty. Full bodied with a nice pepper bite. Both excellent wines!! Okay.... Food. All we ordered was a platter. The Ocean platter. It is normally $21/person!!!!!!!! Holly crap man, why is this so expensive! We went for it because we love seafood. I hate to say but this was so overpriced. I kept waiting for the Alaskan King Crab legs to jump out from under all the salad served with this platter. Honestly, if you are gonna charge that much there should be more actual seafood. It came with two very small pieces of salmon, 4 prawns, and tiny dish of ceviche, a chickpea salad, some bread and crackers, a nice salmon spread, two small pieces of tuna (tataki style I guess). Super not worth it and I would never purchase again. It was good yes, super over priced. I am used to paying up to $24 for a Charcuterie but usually you get quite a bit of cheese and meat and spread ect. CSW if you read this review I seriously think you need to lower the price of this board or add some more seafood to it! We didn\'t order the pizza because we didn\'t wanna break the bank any more Overall I really enjoyed my visit and I would highly recommend checking this place out. Go for happy hour to make it a bit more affordable. Stick with the pizza (hopefully it\'s good)Cheers!', ""City Side Winery is situated in the industrial area of Mount Pleasant, directly across from the ritzy Olympic Village condos. \xa0We decided to try the happy hour since we were close by and we were pretty happy with the selection.The happy hour menu has a good variety of beers, wines and cocktails for about $6.00 and a selection of 8 flatbreads for $10.00 each. \xa0The restaurant is quite large, with plenty of tables and a nice lounge area to relax in. \xa0The mushroom flatbread was delicious, and it even came with a mini side salad. \xa0I'll definitely be back to try the other flatbreads!"", 'We came here on a whim because it\'s literally across the street from our new apartment and I\'ve never been so pleasantly surprised.The fact that it\'s a winery just compounds things as I honestly wasn\'t expecting great food - I was, after all, expecting great wine, full stop.The wine was great - we had the merlot and it was everything I like in a merlot, but the food BLEW ME AWAY.Let me get straight to the food first because that\'s the highlight for me:We shared the ""earth"" tapas and there wasn\'t a thing on there we didn\'t absolutely love and devour. We cleaned our plates so well that our server even commented on it! The meatballs were so delicious, cooked with what tasted like cinnamon and wine, and reminded us of our honeymoon in Morrocco. The braised shortrib was tender and also tasted like it had been cooked in wine - no complaints here, it was so flavourful. And when we told the server we didn\'t eat pork she surprised us by bringing out a truffled cheesy bruschetta as a replacement for the one dish that had chorizo in it. The actual space is also lovely - it\'s got a cosy hipster vibe. Menus are on old vinyl jackets, tables are wood, chairs are like old school chairs and there are long tables with benches for larger parties. There\'s a nook with couches and books and a TV playing Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and the lighting is dim with heaters making the whole place like a warm cosy winter cabin.Soft jazz was playing, there weren\'t a lot of people there for 8pm on a Saturday (great for us, but makes me wish more people knew about this place) and the service was friendly and well timed. We even picked up a bottle of wine on our way out and the somellier was kind enough to let us sample a couple and compare - she was explaining how the Cuvee blend works and you could tell she was passionate about what they\'re doing there.All in all a brilliant dinner spot I would thoroughly recommend for a date night. They also do private events and I think it would be a great spot for a birthday party, or even an engagement dinner.', 'A solid 4.5 stars. Since they first opened, they have done everything right. They have brought in the wine on tap, other beverages including excellent craft beer and cocktails, as well as high quality food including carefully sourced cheese and charcuterie boards. The flatbreads are also all quite tasty - it is hard to recommend one over the other.Above all, it is the great service that blew me away. They are well staffed and very attentive without being overbearing. The ambience was pretty good before but now it is perfect - cozy, warm with the right ratio of sofas, small private tables and larger communal tables. It is also one of the few places where you can have a conversation without losing your voice, so it turned out to be perfect venue to have a book club gathering. A bottle of wine or two later and it turned into wine club! For the extra half star, perhaps bringing in beer on tap? They had a selection of Dieu de Ciel and Category 12 beers in bottles, which was obviously carefully selected for the beer snob (moi!). So all to have to say is keep up the good work!', 'Got a chance to discover City Side Winery tonight during a presentation of Curiate for investors. Turns out they are much more than winery -- a beautiful space with communal tables and a few boardgames, plus a small bites menu including flatbreads.Flatbreads are OK in side and maybe a bit more loaded than stricter Neapolitan style ones for a similar price point. I got to try some proscuitto ones and they were of course salty, but otherwise with a spread that includes some edible garnishes like tomatoes or grapes, each plate is quite nice and tasty.Cheese is spread more or less to the very edge but is not oily or wet there. Toppings are pretty generous (for flatbread style pizza) near the centre. Crust is thin yet firm enough to lift each slice easily -- overall construction is good and convenient.Happy Hours available:-Tuesday to Thursday 4-6pm-$2 off four flights of wine-$3 off flatbread (approximately 25% off!)', ""I noticed Cityside a few weeks ago when I drove by, and then this past Friday when I walked by their big windows and saw all these nice long tapered candles flickering. I gathered up some friends and went tonight for some wine flights. Since they're new, they could only serve flights: 2 (equivalent to 1/2 glass) or 4 (equivalent to one full glass). They kindly gave us a complimentary tasting of all 4 wines before we made our flight choices. They have 2 reds and 2 whites on offer. You don't have to get one of each. In fact, one of my friends liked the Riesling so much she got 4 of them. We sat at the long wooden table with the beautiful candles. This place is so cozy, and nicely appointed. A perfect place to hang out with friends or take a first date.They also offer food: platters of various meats, cheeses, etc. All reasonably priced from around $16-23. We sampled the gourmet meat board and the Mediterranean mezze, which comes with bread and olives.We lost track of time and before we knew it we realized it was well past closing time -- they close at 8pm on Sunday and it was 8:30! Whoops. When we apologized and tried to make a hasty exit, we were reassured that it was okay and they would never kick us out, taking a European stance on closing time. Really nice! I'll be back. Pro-tip: they've got board games!"", ""I have no clue why this place is not always packed with people, but lucky for us the two times we've been it hasn't been. They have a nice section of wines and do flights of either red or white. Well informed staff and great eats make for a fun experience. Would definitely recommend this place to folks who enjoy relaxed wine sipping with friend or family. We shared the Earth tapas platter and not a morsel remained when we were done. We will definitely be back!"", 'Great winery and amazing ambience. The owners are very nice, they make sure you have a good time and receive fantastic service. I highly recommend this place.', ""Came here on a Saturday afternoon. Did a complimentary wine tasting, then ordered a charcuterie and cheese platter and a 4 glass flight of wine each. Great wine, very dry and well priced, and the charcuterie and cheese was delicious and good value. Friendly and helpful staff, and a nice open room.When it came time to pay they were having issues with their credit/debit machine. I had no cash on me but offered to run to a bank machine while my brother waited. They wouldn't hear of it and told me to just come back next time I'm near and were even going to let me take the 2 bottles of wine I wanted to buy with me, even though I hadnt paid for them. I insisted on leaving the wine, and since we were stopping at Olympic village right after I got some cash there and went back to pay the bill. When I went to pay they comped one of our wine flights and part of the food, and wouldn't even let me leave a tip (I tried but they handed back the cash). They definitely went above and beyond to correct a technical problem and I was very impressed with the customer service. Will definitely come back!"", ""I don't know where to start? The ambiance and vibe of City Side is like no other! Cool, funky and acletic. The music and lighting really give a relaxing but upbeat, chill vibe. The wines are delicious, well balanced and pair exceptionally well with their share style tapas menu. Their staff seemed very knowledgeable and genuinely happy to be there and of service to our group. Really great to see these days! If you are looking for a beautiful venue with good food, wine and friendly staff I highly recommend City Side! This is unpretentious fine wine'ing at its best;) Cheers!""]",positive
"[""What an absolutely Amazing experience!A true hidden gem in kits for French Cuisine. From the service to the food down to the ambiance...i felt like having a good dinner by the cobbled stone streets Of France. Each dish meticulously prepared and executed with skill, finesse, and passion for quality food. I couldn't ask for anything more. \xa0portion size was huge, giving you optimal value for your hard earned money. We ordered the cauliflower gruyere cheese with french baguette for appys. the duck confit and seafood pasta for mains. The appy came smoking hot! The cheese was gooey and fresh. Even the baguette was still steaming from the inside. A testament that it is made fresh. The bread was crusty on the outside but so flaky and soft on the inside. Baked in-house to the highest levels. The duck confit was perfectly done. But i think they even raised up the bar by a bit bec i feel like they smoked the duck too. I can smell the earth smoky aroma. The skin was so crispy but he meat fall off the bone juicy and tender. Perfect execution by a master chef. Each and every piece of veggies was still smoking hot, and the sweet potato pieces provided a good balance to the palette. Lastly, the seafood pasta was also excellent. The clams and mussels tasted so fresh and the sauce was not heavy. Just a touch of white wine with the cream sauce, provided such good sauce base. I have to give properPraises to the chef behind the scene in this place.he is truly a master chef. This place would put many French restaurants in vancouver to shame for sure. Service was impeccable and outstanding. I will be back for sure! Cheers! happy eating!!"", ""This was one of the best places I've ever visited. Our host Eric was so kind, talking to us and checking in on how we were doing, and he allowed us to sit by the open window which made a very pleasant experience as we were able to look out over the sidewalk and street. I ordered the three course meal of the onion tart, duck confit and the dessert of berries crumble a la mode. They all far surpassed my expectations, but my favorite was the onion tart because of the flakiness of the tart and the soft cheese and onions baked within it. The portions were very generous and I was left feeling completely and pleasantly stuffed. Will definitely come again when I visit Vancouver!"", 'Came for weekend brunch recently and was surprised that they were pretty quiet for lunch time in this area. Especially since the food was pretty good and reasonably priced. I wanted to try their duck confit benedict but on that day, they were out so I settled for the saumon fume benedict ($13.50). This was your typical benny and came with smashed potatoes. Hubby got the moules frites ($17) which was delicious; plump mussels and great tasting sauce. We would come back just for this dish. They only had one server so service was a bit slow. Definitely not a hurried brunch.', 'What a pleasant evening dining at La Cigale !!! The food is authentic, our host Eric is very very very nice. Eric is professional, caring and always has a smile on his face ( I can tell even his face is behind the mask). The 3 course meal is such a great surprise !!!

They just recently revamped their menu and have yet to update the link.They have a set three course meal which is $32 dollars. Well worth it. I should have taken a picture of that menu but I forgot.You can always order off the regular menu.For starters, I had the escargot which were well seasoned and very garlicky. They were very tasty, but I don't think escargot is my thing.For my main I had the beef cheeks. \xa0OH BABY, words cannot describe how good this meal was. The cheeks cane with mashed potatoes and a generous serving of mixed veggies.The service was excellent.

I had to add some salt and pepper because it could have used a tiny bit more spice. I love the fact that it was served with salad and potatoes, and the portion was satisfying. Overall, the place is a bit pricey, but would definitely come again to try more things. (En plus, j'ai été agréablement surprise d'apercevoir que les employés sont Français ou parlent français, ce qui ajoute de l'authenticité au resto.)"", ""This place was yummy and good value. \xa0I ordered the $32 price fixe menu which comes with three items: \xa0- appetizer (salad, French onion soup, onion tart), - main entree (beef cheeks, \xa0duck confit, seafood pasta, etc) and - dessert (crepe brûlée, chocolate mousse, cheese)I ordered - the onion tart (big enough to share, very tasty and filling after eating half), - the duck confit - wow, amazing. The beans with ham combined with a taste of the duck, was truly out of this world. \xa0Parts of the duck may have been a little dry and a little bit of the marmalade helped sweeten and lighten up the taste- the chocolate mousse was goodIf you go with two people, could probably order one price fixe and one regular entree. Or go all out and order two price fixe items as you're only spending a little more... however, fair warning, you may overeat"", ""Really nice restaurant with very friendly service! Dishes I like here are the escargot (with baguette of course), beef bourguignon, and lamb. The French onion soup isn't to my taste though since it's made with a vegetarian broth and so I find it lacks the richness that I like. The cheese on it is great though. If you like ile flottante, they have a beautiful presentation. A quaint little place that's quickly becoming a regular spot for me!"", ""Great atmosphere, great staff! Reminded me of France because they make their food fresh and with care (translation: very slow). I didn't mind it because of the quality of the dishes they put out. The portions are large, so if you're just visiting, you may consider sharing with someone!"", 'Superb! Magnifique!La Cigale is simply the best french food restaurant in Vancouver. You can enjoy excellent food in an intimate atmosphere, the service is at a personal level with the owners taking pride on the quality of each dish and making sure everything is done right. We had escargot to die for! Duck confit was glorious and the lamb shank falling off the bone melts in your mouth with an explosion of flavour.

"[""Excellent ambience, service, and food. We had reservations at 7:30P on a Saturday and unlike many Boston restaurants were seated right on time -- so thumbs up for that. We were seated in a nice booth (that I believe our host has reserved in advance). We were very happy with our cocktails. The LIchitini was delicious as was another cocktail we got (I want to say volcano, but I'm not 100% sure of the name). The appetizers were good -- I especially liked the soft shell crab. For dinner, we shared this fabulous shogan combo, which came out smoking (dry ice) with tons of outstanding sushi and sashimi. The lobster rolls were especially interesting, but everything was very fresh and delicious."", ""The ambience was beautiful. The koi fish were pleasing.

The rest of our party was very pleased with their orders and we can't wait to go back!"", ""I say go for it If you are going for the food but the costumer care in this establishment needs improvement. The reception was not really pleasant when we arrived. They seemed to forget about us after we set at the lobby area waiting for someone to bring us to a table. It wasn't until I walked up to the reception area and asked what was going on that they realized we were still there waiting. They seated us in a corner of the restaurant which was secluded and wasn't to pleasant to be at. The waiter did take a while to assist us as well. I had looked up this place before I went there and it looked like a beautiful spot to spend a night eating shushi, it was very contrary of what I expected. The drink I ordered came in a regular cup nothing compared to other places I've ordered at or the cute looking ones I had seen in pictures online. The food on the other hand was very tasty and the display was cute, although it did not come in a boat exactly as it displayed from the other reviewers here on yelp."", ""AMBIENCE:- Came here for a girls night dinner. My girlfriends all loved the place and thought it was super cute. We got to sit in one of the private rooms which was very niceSERVICE:- Great service as always. The waitress was very nice and came pretty quickly when we pressed the call button. Although the food took quite a long time. Even though we were busy with conversations and catching up with each other we noticed the food took its time to get to us.FOOD/DRINKS:- Spicy Girl Maki = tempura was nice and crunchy on the inside and the fish with avocado was nice and fresh. Good portion size for the fish too. Only thing was that the generous eel sauce + the avocado took away some of the texture of the roll that even the tempura was not enough to negate.- Spicy Salmon Maki = can't really go wrong with this classic. I did not realize it was chopped salmon though so I didn't like it as much as I would've. I feel like chopping up the salmon takes away some of the fresh fish flavor that salmon is so well known forOVERVIEW:- Great place for groups. A little bit pricier than other sushi places but great for dine in & the fish is very fresh."", ""Most excellent Japanese food in Brookline, on par with meals in New York, San Francisco, Vancouver.Get a private booth.

Each time was a good experience. This time I got the sukiyaki. Sukiyaki is a Japanese style hotpot where the sauce compared to other hotspot, is more sweet than savory. There's an abundant amount of beef up in this dish. There's also an abundant amount of vegetables etc. basically all you can expect in a traditional Chinese hotpot but the broth is sweeter. They give you an raw egg that you mix and dip the meat into. One thing about the meat is that it is cooked medium rare, so it is still a little pink. They offer to cook it for you in the kitchen if you order 1 sukiyaki but if you order more than 1, they bring out the stove and you can cook it for yourself for that experience. However, it is probably best to just have them cook it in the kitchen."", ""Good place, mediocre sushi.Went for a date night and had a great time! We got one of the little rooms with a sliding door, super cool and private. That was probably the best part of the meal though. We ordered a sushi boat, but the selection was weird. Way too much sashimi compared to nigiri, and the chefs choices were interesting (pickled mackerel and tamago were not great). Both of us agreed that we'd have rather gone to our local cheap sushi spot, as the quality and taste was pretty similar, but for a fraction of the price."", ""This restaurant has a fun atmosphere especially for children. My kids loved the closing booths and the coy fish. However the sushi was blah to not very good. The seaweed salad was very good as was the service.

Very rarely (pun unintended) do I find a steakhouse that knows how a Medium Rare steak should be cooked. I ordered the New York Strip, medium rare. Upon cutting into the steak, it was a beautiful pink with a warm red center....literally the definition of what medium rare should look like. It was also very tender, juicy, and well-marbled (aside from the small layer of fat that naturally occurs on the steer's back). I also had a two of my girlfriend's pork ribs. They were perfect: not too fatty, but tender and came right off the bone. The BBQ sauce was perfectly set from the grill; even the end rib had a hint of char that reminded me \xa0that these bad boys were cooked over an open flame.As for the service....I was blown away at how friendly everyone was.

The manager, Jesse, even came by later to offer a sundae for carry out (because I had declined to have one brought to the table for my birthday because I was so full from the ribs).Overall, it was a fantastic birthday dinner, and I am VERY glad we chose Longhorn Steakhouse.

I had no trouble with reservations and the location was pretty filled when we did go on a Wednesday Night for 7pm, so definitely is a good call to make a reservation (However they only take group reservations). \xa0Our waiter was everything you would expect , want and need from hipsterish restaurant... A hipster.. He was extra cool, laid back, but also very knowledgeable and helpful, about the different share dishes we would get for the table, specifically in helping us gage portion sizes. The items I had a chance to taste included: Original Fried Chicken, BBQ Pork Ribs, Cider Brined Pork Chop, Flat Iron Steak, Low Country Meat and Cheese Board, East Caroline Cheese Biscuit, Tynan's Mac & Cheese. My favorites were the fried chicken, pork chop and Mac & Cheese. The Mac and Cheese took a moment to grow on me, but once they cooled down the greatness of the cheese and flavor thickness took over and made me adore these mac & cheese. The chicken was hot and cooked on the spot, which was beautiful mix that with the right amount of spices without making it spicy put it in a whole new game of greatness. The pork chop flavor was delicious, it was juicy and thick. I would definitely eat at this location again.For my cocktail, I went with a Kentucky Mule which included bourbon. lemon. ginger beer. Simple yet refreshing drink to accompany dinner.This is a great date location or small group outing in my opinion. There is street parking, shouldn't have too much trouble finding parking in the area."", 'We came for lunch and it was pretty busy but we only had to wait 10 minutes. We were seated in front of the window area. I ordered the shakshuka ($14) which was a tomato stew and it was highly recommended. But I did not enjoy it at all. The toast that it came with was burnt. The bell peppers overpowered the stew. It just tasted like peppers and tomatoes. The bf got the burger ($15) and it had red bell peppers with onion rings. It was a pretty tasty burger but the bun had way too much sesame seed. We also got an order of the french toast and potatoes brava. I would say the the french toast and potatoes were the best. The french toast had a good pear taste to it and it was refreshing. I loved the potatoes too! It was coated with cheese and topped with an egg. The service was not that great. The only time we saw her was when she took our order and brought out our food. Then we had to flag her down for our bill because she never came back. The seating was also pretty cramped and too close to the neighbors. The hostess looked mad all the time and werent greeted when we arrived or when we left.', ""Still one of the most consistent restaurants I've been to in Portland. We came here for brunch recently and everything tasted amazing as usual. The wait time was not too bad since we came in the early afternoon. \xa0Some of the items we ordered included: - Potatoes Bravas: perfectly cooked with an egg on top- Maple n Cumin glazed yam: nice soft texture; not too sweet and had good flavors- Fried chicken biscuit: simply delicious- Steak n eggs: came in a cast iron with jalapeno butter over the cornbread; great!- Shakshuka: baked egg and tomato stew with sausage added- Chicken fried pork cutlets: with gravy, biscuit, and an egg- Side of friesAgain, everything was delicious and we left satisfied. The server was friendly and made sure we had everything needed."", ""Feeling Brunchy?Tasty & Sons is a foodie delight in Northeast Portland. The menu items are shareable, and for brunch I'd recommend ordering something savory, and something sweet.For Savory: Order the Shakshuka, with baked eggs, roasted peppers & tomato stew, and add the sausage.For Sweet: Order Erin's Sweet Biscuits, with huckleberry compote, powdered sugar, and whipped cream."", ""We didn't want to chance it and wait for hours at one of the uber popular brunch spots in town so we decided to try Tasty n Sons. This is sister restaurant to their OG spot, Tasty n Alder.We dropped in on a late Saturday afternoon (around 1:00pm) and lucked out; barely a wait. We were seated at the kitchen bar so we got to enjoy the chefs dancing and jamming to the music. We could also see the charcuterie slicer getting a constant workout. Our waitress was fine but we had some trouble flagging her down.The brunch menu is split into smaller, boards, salads, bigger and sides. The drink menu is much bigger with bubbles, wines, beer, cider, cocktails and no proof.- Coffee ($3.50 US) - pretty pricey for a regular cup of joe but at least you get free refills.- Moroccan chicken hash ($13.00 US) - came with harissa cream, an over easy egg and side of bread. The potatoes were solid and not too salty. Chicken had a subtle lemon undertone to it. Cauliflower bits were a pleasant surprise.- Shakshuka ($14.00 US) - baked eggs, roasted red pepper, tomato stew and charred bread. This was excellent! Bread was perfectly toasted and you could taste the smoke on it. Everything about this dish was well balanced and satisfying.Good food and a fun ambiance at TnS.

The bambino plate was a great value and included their perfect biscuit. \xa0Request some jam because you will get two house made jams, ours were strawberry and vanilla apricot. \xa0The polenta Bolognese was hearty stick to your ribs good.

"[""Went with a Meet-up group to this strange restaurant with a lot going for it. Perhaps it's got too much going for it? It is East meets West. Russian and Pan Asian. The food was good, but the servers were a bit frazzled by having customers. My only Atlanta Russian restaurant to compare this restaurant against is Nikolai's Roof, which is extreme high dining with chefs and city views and high prices and snobbery. A-priori was trying to be classy and formal, but with houkahs, mid level drinks, and a singing, overly loud DJ. The managers are in suits, the waitresses in ripped jeans. The mismatched chairs and the fancily rolled paper napkins in the water glasses create a juxtaposition that is bizarre. With such a shortage of Russian offerings in town, I don't want this place to go. But it's not a pyre slice of Moscow on Buford highway. Enjoy it for the blender mash-up that it IS. I intend to go back and try this place again, but this time off the Meet-up sampler menu..."", 'I\'ve had A-Priori on my radar for quite some time now, ever since they opened back in 2015. It\'s officially the only Russian restaurant in the Atlanta area. Coming from one of the former Eastern block countries, I was quite excited to check it out when one of my Meetup groups organized a dinner event here.The dinner was originally scheduled for a Friday night but the restaurant apparently booked another party and could not accommodate us (this was with less than a day of notice). We had to move it to Saturday but ""they felt bad"" and have worked out a set Russian menu for us to try a variety of dished for $25/pp.The decor is unexpected for a place on BuHi where we are all used to ""hole-in-a-wall"" places with not much ambiance. This resto features a hookah lounge with leather couches and a nicely appointed dining room. There is also a DJ booth and a full bar.For my drink I wanted a manhattan but the ""bartender"" didn\'t know how to make it! They did have Makers and vermouth so go figure. My friend ordered a caipirinha, which was on their drink menu but apparently they didn\'t have the ingredients for it, so he settled on G&T. Having a full bar and not knowing what to do with it just makes me cringe.When I first arrived, there were already some apps on the table, consisting of mini crepes filled with caviar, korean carrot salad (it\'s actually a very popular item on a Russian menu), eggplant roll ups (stuffed with walnut mix), herring under a fur coat (look it up), olivie salad (similar to a potato salad) and a salsa-ish relish. They later (MUCH later) brought out Uzbek samsa (a samosa-like pastry) filled with beef and onions and Russian dumplings (pelmeni). The only ones I truly enjoyed was the korean carrot salad and the pelmeni. The rest wasn\'t truly authentic or memorable. The amount of food was disproportionately small to the size of our table. We each only got to try one spoonful of each dish. The actual entrees took FOREVER; people started to get agitated and hangry but the owner (who was managing the event) did not really do anything to make us feel better. Some vodka on the house would have definitely helped. For the entree we got mixed kabobs (shashlyki) with fried potatoes and soup ""harcho"". The chicken kabob was surprisingly juicy and flavorful - another dish that tasted authentic to me. The lamb was also pretty good but the beef was totally overcooked and tough. The portion was tiny. They only brought out one platter for the entire table and we each got one piece of chicken, steak, and lamb.Overall: nice atmosphere, live DJ (who also sings), full bar (but get a beer here or a {booze}+soda), hookah, dancing later in the night. I can\'t truly comment on the food as I didn\'t really get the idea of the dish sizes with everything served family style. I can only say that I left hungry and disappointed and it doesn\'t take a lot to feed me. The company was great though and made up for the restaurant experience.', 'A-Priori Seafood Restaurant opened January 2015 on Buford Highway OTP (outside the perimeter) in the same two-story shopping center as Woo Nam Jeong Stone Bowl House and Man Chun Hong. It replaced Korean sushi restaurant Tairyou.This shopping center has a small surface lot. If this lot is full, there\'s additional parking available in a deck below street level.I asked owner Vladimir what type of seafood restaurant A-Priori is and he described the cuisine to me as ""seafood fusion."" The dishes strike me as generally higher-end seafood fare with modern, European, and Italian influences. Vlad is proud of the fresh-never-frozen seafood he sources as well as his all-organic produce and dairy products, several of which come from Atlanta\'s own Buford Highway Farmers Market.The restaurant looks nice. It\'s got an upscale ambiance to it with white tablecloths, folded napkins, and a formally dressed waitstaff in white dress shirts, black ties, and black vests -- things not commonly seen on Buford Highway. The interior is elegant and classy, similar to the old Tairyou, but mostly redone. There\'s lots of finished wood and paneling. Some of the Japanese-style sliding doors remain including one set that leads to an intimate private dining room.A-Priori has a little bit of everything when it comes to seafood such as ceviche, jumbo lump crab cakes, fried oysters (unfortunately, no raw oysters), lobster tails, PEI (Prince Edward Island) mussels, lobster bisque, and shrimp and grits. Expect to spend about $12-15 each for most appetizers and $20-25 each for most entrees.Here\'s what I\'ve tried:Appetizers:* Fried Oysters - pickled mushrooms, BBQ mayo, coleslaw* Grilled Calamari - edamame salad, spicy sherry vinaigretteEntrees:* Grilled Spanish Octopus - organic baby kale, green tomatoes, and beans* Fish & Chips - ale-battered cod, crispy potatoes, malt vinegar aioli* Two Moroccan Braised Lamb Shanks - roasted root veggies, sun-dried apricots, and olives.* Mahi-mahi (special) with organic baby kale, tomatoes, capers, sprouts, pesto* Whole Baby Tuna (off-menu) - lemon, asparagus, tomatoes, pickled onion, spinach, kale, red pepper chimichurri sauce* Dorado fish (off-menu) with sauteed spinach, tomatoes, green olives, and capers* Grilled Mediterranean Squid (off-menu) - organic baby kale, sprouts, sweet chili sauceMeals start off with complimentary garlic-cheese bread sticks with a side of marinara dipping sauce with mascarpone cheese. Not bad, standard stuff.I think both the Fried Oyster and Grilled Calamari apps are pretty good. In general, the seafood is indeed fresh and this freshness is evident in most of the dishes. Four oysters come to an order of the Fried Oysters. The BBQ mayo, slaw, and mushrooms are a nice touch. As for the calamari, you can choose to have it fried or grilled. I prefer grilled as there\'s no oily batter and I can enjoy the true flavor and texture of the calamari better. The calamari includes both rings and legs and is served with a side of marinara, greens, and tomatoes.Much like the calamari, I like the flavor and texture of the Grilled Spanish Octopus. This dish is heavy on the tomatoes, but has crisp green beans and soft baby kale leaves. Tomatoes and/or kale show up in many of the dishes. It would be good if there was more variety.I like the Fish & Chips. It\'s comfort food. A-Priori serves actual potato chips with its fish & chips. The fried cod is light and gratifying.For a seafood restaurant, the Lamb Shanks are better than I expected. The shanks are thick, hearty, and tender. The not-too-fatty meat forks apart easily, is savory and not unpleasantly gamey. Nice.Of the fish I\'ve tried (Mahi-mahi, Baby Tuna, Dorado), my favorite is the dorado. Mahi-mahi and dorado are technically the same fish, but A-Priori makes a distinction between the two. They\'re prepared quite differently. The dorado is baked and sports a slightly browned, flavorful, silver skin served with cooked spinach and a tomato salad. The mahi-mahi, grilled, is served in a bowl with what looks to be a tomato sauce along with pesto and various vegetables.The Baby Tuna is disappointing. It\'s a nice, meaty fish and the accompanying veggies are tasty. However, it\'s difficult to eat around the fish\'s many small bones due to the tuna\'s dense, chunky, and somewhat pasty meat. It\'s cooked rare.The Grilled Mediterranean Squid is my favorite entree. Similar to the calamari, but bigger, the Mediterranean squid has a delicious smoky flavor to it and I love its firm, appetizing consistency. I recommend it.At the time of writing this review, A-Priori is still working on its dessert menu (and liquor license). I\'ve tried three different, bread-based cakes, some of which resemble baklava with their many layers. They contain a combination of chocolate and yogurt with ripe blueberries and raspberries. Try them if they\'re available.Service is great. Vlad is hospitable and server Sofiya is friendly and terrific.', 'Talk about a special hole in a wall in the middle of nowhere Doraville BUT well worth the drive. \xa0A priori is located in an Asian strip mall and you\'d never guess that it houses what is, in my opinion, Atlanta\'s best European inspired seafood eatery, hands down!You enter into a modern yet vintage french shabby chic decor with elevator jazz music playing in the backdrop. \xa0Friendly hostesses and waitresses of Eastern European accent give away the establishment\'s part Russian heritage ownership. \xa0As we sat down, a basket of bread sticks alongs with a house made marinara sauce came to the table. \xa0The menu is not cluttered at all; it has over a dozen items this establishment does, and I can confirm very, very well; read on. We ordered the Spanish octopus for the table as an appetizer even though it is in the main course section of the menu; it was sooooooo tender and the accompanying beans and kale were unique and gave it a distinct flavour that is not found anywhere; best dish by far in any seafood restaurant in Atlanta! Bring it on!!! \xa0Continuing with appetizers, we also ordered the Lobster tail and mussels which were served on a plate in a yellow sauce that was very tangy and memorable. \xa0The seafood soup was good but ordinary and won\'t be a repeat.For the main course, I ordered the whole fish which was broiled to perfection. \xa0It came with steamed vegetables and again, yes, it was perfectly perfect, mmmm! My friend ordered the hens with mashed potatoes, asparagus and grilled mushrooms which were equally amazing as I sampled a few bites of everything. \xa0Delicious sides of smoked salmon fried rice and grilled asparagus completed this outstanding seafood experience.Well, after this feast, we were way too full for desserts but didn\'t feel bloated at all; that saying when great food fills your tummy ""happily full"" definitely applies. \xa0A Priori is a restaurant I will be ranting and raving about for its wow seafood dishes. \xa0Both preparation and presentation make it a destination well worth the drive in the boonies of suburbia; oui, oui.', '==Cheese bread with marinara sauceWas too busy taking pictures to eat right away. Although the bread was room temperature by then, I still enjoyed the cheese flavor and dipping it in the tomato sauce (that was not too sour!).==Ceviche Comes with crispy plantains in a pretty glass. Interesting delicious combination of sour, sweet, and spicy flavors! The seafood portions were plump and generous. This was refreshing and a perfect way to stimulate the palates for the next courses. I definitely recommend to those who favor citrus flavors.==Almond and parmesan baked tilapiaThe fish portions were generous with two pieces (I took one home). I enjoyed the crispy crust and the tender fish. It comes on a bed of various veggies. I enjoyed the kale. The green beans were definitely better with the sauce. Speaking of which, the sauce had a unique taste that I have never had before. I want to call it ""curry""-like but it was not as thick... or spiced. Give it a try!==Soy-marinated flank steakTender steak as it was ordered medium. Can definitely taste and smell the soy which made the dish intensely and pleasingly flavorful. It comes with a potato/vegetable medley. Now I do have a ""potato tooth"" and these soft potato cubes balanced the steak perfectly. I definitely was surprised that a seafood place did this meat dish so well. Don\'t discriminate now! It is even presented beautifully (as was the tilapia). I like the colorful little flowers. Accidentally ate them? No worries! Waitress reassures us that they are edible.==Green beansNormal green beans. I thought it would have been more interesting with garlic. I tossed this into the sauce that came with my entree veggies to give this a twist.Ambiance is elegant. There is a private room that seats 6 but since there were no reservations and it was a slow evening, they seated us in there. It was romantic. The music fit the mood but would be even better if turned down just a wee bit. I saw that there were dimming lights and sliding doors but we did not bother to adjust. The hostess and waitress were both very gracious and friendly and competent!There\'s limited parking as it shares a lot with other businesses. There may be additional parking nearby but we got lucky and found a spot as another patron left.', ""I got disappointed. Service was slow even if restaurant was empty. For everything you ask they don't have it.For people who like hookah \xa0bring your own flavor, charcoals and tips their suggestion.Old but good music."", ""We frequently go to a korean restaurant near by but decided to give some place new a try. Man.. I wishwe spent that money and time at the Korean restaurant we always go to. Nobody was in the restaurant despite it being a Friday night and prime dinner time. Should have been a sign to leave... The waitress was nice but mumbled, asking us to take a seat. They also gave us some complementary appetizers; some crap in a spoon and some nasty ass microwaved old cheese bread with cheap ass marinara sauce. Again, should have just left. The waitress, like I said, was nice, but very clueless and spoke broken English and when we asked questions about the menu, she went to ask someone... every single time. Might as well just bring out the manager or whoever can answer questions. We ordered about three dishes. Literally took an hour to get any dish. One was a seafood dish that says it has 4 or 5 different seafood varieties, we only got 2 different kinds of seafood - lobster tail (which was super dry and chewy) and shrimp. When we asked the waitress what was going on, of course, she left to ask and was gone for a good 5 minutes. Finally a guy came out, apologised and we got a discount. \xa0Getting all of our money back wouldn't have subsided the anger, disappointment and general disgusting taste the food left in our mouths. Never again will we return. I'm surprised this place is still open.**EDIT**Just incase the owner decides to delete their horrible comment, I'm posting the screen capture. What kind of a business starts a war with customers who leave comments? LISTEN TO YOUR CUTOMERS! or else you'll be out of business very soon. Or maybe you are just angry because you're doing so poorly? Well, you deserve it if you can't take criticism. Whatever, it's you that'll suffer.

It was a Friday night. We waited for an hour and a half to get dishes. \xa0Most of waitress chose to ignore us and stand way far away to avoid services. The dished are less than okay, oily and not so tasty. My fish of the day is good, but that was probably the best on table. At last, the owner came to explain that the chef went to the hospital with the dishwasher. Of course, we could not verify the story, but according to the yelp review two days ago, the story did not happen today at least. YET, they chose to open the restaurant, let us to wait for sooo long, which did not make any sense, and served mediocre meals made by the owner. At the last, they told us this drama. Not PROFESSIONAL at all. The visit is a rip off, and a waste of time. They should just close the restaurant while the chef is away.', 'Please ""Do Not Go Here"" this place is horrible and the food is not worth your money .

I swear to God I will never go here again .. I recommended no one should go here to have dinner ..', ""A Priori is a seafood restaurant owned by a Korean-Russian owner. They pride themselves on fresh and organic ingredients. The owner knows some people at the Buford Hwy Farmer's Market, so he has inside access to their fresh ingredients. \xa0A-Priori serves seafood mostly. Even though the owner is a Russian-Korean, the food seems more European influenced. The interior looked very nice. It looked fancy and decadent. I felt like I was in a 5-star restaurant. The servers were very nice and helpful. Sofiya was our server. She answered all of our questions. I loved the service here. It felt like a high-end restaurant for the level of service. I was actually surprised how well the front of the house was run for a new restaurant. Usually new restaurants have so many people training, the service suffers. A-Priori seemed to have nailed that down. I tried a lot of stuff on their menu. I love seafood so I was excited. Let's break down some of the highlights:The Fried Oysters were good. It came with about 5 Oysters, battered and fried. I liked the flavor and the batter. The mayo and cole slaw matched well with the fried oysters. Their Ceviche was good. It needed more citrus, acidy taste to it though. Maybe I'm too used to the Mexican or Latin American versions of Ceviche. I don't know. The flavor was too mild for me. The Seafood Pasta was decent. It was too sandy though. Sandy shellfish is a pet peeve of mine. They need to clean it more. The sauce's flavor was fine, a bit on the bland side. The sauce needed a bit more umph to it. I also hoped the noodles were hand made. But i don't think it was. Oh well. I tried their Two Moroccan Braised Lamb Shanks. It came with Lamb on top of rice. The lamb was cooked well. It fell off the bone quite nicely. \xa0The flavor was decent, but again the flavor seemed too mild. It needed a little more salt I guess? I was hoping for some good, Moroccan spices flavoring the dish. It need more flavor boost for me. I liked the Fish and Chips. I thought the batter was nice and crispy. The cod seemed fresh. The chips were actually American potato chips, not french fries. The chips did taste good though. I tried their Grilled Calamari. It was okay. I wished the calamari was grilled a bit more. However, I tried their Mediterranean Grilled Squid. \xa0Mediterranean Grilled Squid is not on their menu, but we got to try it. I loved it. The squid was grilled well. It actually had a Korean-ish feel to it. I would order the Mediterranean Grilled Squid instead of the Grilled Calamari.Their Grilled Spanish Octopus looked great. It was okay. If you want grilled cephalopods, I would stick with the Mediterranean Grilled Squid. That one is the best. I did like the edamame in this dish though. I got to try another thing not on the menu yet, their baby tuna. It comes with the entire fish, head and all. It was good. They cook it a bit rare, but the flavor and texture was great. If you love tuna, this is a great dish to get. It is a bit bony though, so watch out for the bone. \xa0Overall, I thought the food was good. I like how they use fresh, organic ingredients. Their presentation looked excellent. All of our dishes looked beautiful. Flavor wise, most of the dishes were on the bland side. They do have potential though. They are still figuring out their menu and they're new. I'm sure they'll nail down their dishes.Their prices seem decent. A lot of their dishes can be shared. Their portions seem great for the price. I suggest bringing a few friends and trying them out family style.""]",negative

I ordered their Whistler (foccacia bread, roast beef, red onion, asiago cheese, mozzarella, horseradish mayo) and a fruit salad. The panini was delicious, the roast beef not too dry, the horseradish flavour well paired with the meat and choice of cheese.

No joke, it had the consistency of natto--just brown, stringy, slimey tasteless snot. It was like it had been left in a pot from two days ago. It immediately went in the garbage.At this point I called JustEat to request a refund for the missing and disgusting items. I was put on hold for 10+ minutes while my breakfast got cold, while the JustEat rep tried to track down someone from this restaurant.

So that's what I ordered. My friend ordered some mixed ribs. The waitress, I forgot her name, was rude while taking down our orders. I shrugged it off like she was having a bad day. But were they all having a bad day or something?The food came to us and it was dry as hell! I expected juicy and flavorful. But it was nothing even close. I couldn't even eat it all. My friend didn't either. We just paid and left. There's no way I'm ever going back to that establishment. It's like we were not welcomed for no apparent reason or that everyone was just having a bad day and should be fired. Hire new help."", ""Good food, when they get it right. We've gotten takeout from here maybe 5 times and our order has been entirely correct/as expected maybe once. I've ordered the Mac and Cheese entree w/ pulled pork multiple times for example, and each time it's a different size (ranging from the full takeout container you'd expect for an entree of that price one time to a small soup-sized container for the same menu item and price the next time). Tastes very good when it's correct, but the inconsistency has us not coming back regularly even when that BBQ craving strikes."", 'The food itself was excellent. We picked up and the food was hot and tasted fresh. The app is horrendously designed and it told is our order would be ready in 8 minutes which was ridiculous. It was ready in about 35 minutes \xa0which I expected.We are not from the area and the Smokey Bones in our area is not known for great customer service so I was wary of this chain. \xa0This location had an overall inviting modern appearance, but it\'s obvious it\'s not well maintained. \xa0The main ""Smokey Bones"" sign had all the letters burned out except the ""s"" and the ""m"". \xa0And the sign over the main entrance was not even working. The entrance door was so heavy that I initially thought it was locked when I tried to do the pandemic ""one finger pull"" on it. Turns out it was just heavy or stuck. I gave it a significant pull and it jarred free, but this is obviously not handicap accessible. Once inside I was greeted to a regular loud beeping sound from the fire alarm panel indicating an error. None of the employees seemd concerned as it beeped every 30 seconds while I was there for 20 minutes waiting for the food. \xa0The restaurant was pretty much empty and one of the employees appeared asleep at the bar probably on her break. The rest room smelled like something died in there a week ago and the trash bin was overfilled. It didn\'t appear very clean.The gentleman who gave me my order was friendly and cordial.. seemed like the manager. Got to the car and immediately double-checked the order. \xa0I quicky realized we were missing 3 items from our order and no ketchup was provided for the 4 orders of fries. Had to head back inside. They were all nice \xa0and apologetic but imagine how disappointed we would have been had we driven home before checking or had it delivered? The food was great so obviously the kitchen has it\'s act together. However, overall the restaurant seemed somewhat poorly managed.', 'This is based on my takeout experience on the Saturday of Father\'s Day weekend. I feel like I\'m being really generous with a 3 star rating, but people were nice and some of the major foods were up to par...more on that later. I\'m mostly being considerate of the time we\'re in.I basically chopped up my whole takeout experience to it being an odd time with little staff (maybe 4 different staff members that I saw in the dining room?). I put in my order at 1:14pm to pick up at 2pm. Arrived late and 2:20pm, and two staff members were wiping menus. Maybe they didn\'t hear me come in. A server saw me and talked to the other two briefly before asking how she could help me. She kindly checked on my pickup order, which took a few minutes, then she told me it would be another minute. It was more like 10 minutes, but I was very cognizant that places were still just starting to open up again and there may not be a lot of staff. There weren\'t many tables seated, but there could have been two chefs in the kitchen, for all I knew. Someone brought out my food, and I asked if that was all (there was one bag, and I ordered quite a bit). I didn\'t get an answer before she walked away. Maybe she didn\'t hear me? I counted how many boxes there were in the trunk of my car, as I was matching it to the number of highlighted items on the receipt because I live half an hour away without traffic. Well, that was a mistake because it was discovered when I got home that one item was missing. Looking at the receipt more carefully, it was the only item not highlighted. I felt really bad because I had guests over, and one guest was completely missing a meal. All of us ended up sharing what we did have. I feel like there should be at least two order checks before giving customers their orders. I also missed that an item was missing, but should that responsibility have been on me to open every single container and match it to my order? Again, I was disappointed, and I understand mistakes happen.Here\'s what\'s really bothering me. I called the restaurant after taking more than 45 minutes to get home (it was a special request to go to Smokey Bones after a decade of positive memories there), and the phone rang way more than 10 times, but fine, maybe it was the understaffed issue. Someone picked up and was kind and said I could for sure just get a refund for the missing item. I asked if she needed my card number, and she said they could just look it up by the order. Didn\'t sound like she was doing it at the moment, and I should have pushed the issue, because it\'s more than two weeks later, and there\'s no refund in sight. I spent so much time to write a thoughtful and detailed review of my experience through the rating link that was sent to me through email, and left my email and phone number to contact me regarding the experience (a question asked if I wanted to be contacted or not), and I still haven\'t heard back. In terms of what we did get:- the rib-eye, fire grilled shrimp, and lemon pepper mahi mahi were all cooked well and passed the taste test for everyone- the cornbread, hamburger, onion rings, baked beans, and street corn were fine/average- the cinnamon apples were way too sweet, and the Mac and cheese was less than satisfying in flavor.Finally, there was a beeping sound from the panel right beside the entrance doors. Fine, not a big deal, but I read a review from much earlier that it was happening then. I have no issue with any staff members personally because I think everyone is just trying their hardest, but the ball has been dropped twice. First, by whomever was supposed to look up my order and issue the refund in ""3 to 5 business days,"" as well as whoever is supposed to reach out to customers who are looking for a return call or email to discuss the experience, based on the detailed rating and response that was requested. I took the time to write then, and I\'m taking the time to write now. How much more time before I hear back about a simple refund?', ""If you eat here sit at the bar! I was excited to eat at smoky bones today but unfortunately I had a horrible experience. Working in the service industry isn't easy and I know from many years of experience but we literally sat for 15 minutes without any team members acknowledgement. 2 server walked past to greet their tables. I had to get up and ask for a server 2 times. We finally got our drinks and my correct wine at 745, we arrived at 7pm. By 8pm I just wanted to walkout \xa0so we asked the server to please put our food togo.

I ordered the Four Cheese pizza and the cotton candy cocktail (Both 1/2 off due to happy hour!) and it was such an amazing deal. The pizza was extremely filling and I even had leftovers.

You can add a mimosa to your brunch option too! They also have vegan and gluten free choices!Seating: LOTS of seating options; bar, high tops, booths. We were seated at a 4-person high top right by the entrance.

So we settled for 6. I think 6 is usually the max so someone got booted off haha just kidding! We squeezed into a booth and we were fine! Our server was incredible and super understanding. I got the Kiwi Mule, very delicious and light! Barely tasted the alcohol and I loved it. Then I got the Blue Orchid, just as amazing as the previous drink. This one definitely had more alcohol in it.

They do have two separate bar areas, but due to short staffing only had one of them open when we went. They only have a few draft beers, but the cocktail menu is pretty extensive. We tried the burrata appetizer and it was amazing -- highly recommended. Our bartender was super nice and spent extra time getting to know us despite being pretty busy. Overall, Forno met the expectations I had been hearing about, and I will definitely be back in the not so distant future -- likely to try one of their specialty pizzas!"", ""A Columbus classic. Anyone who is local to Cbus knows that Forno is a staple! Is it the most authentic Italian food you will ever have in your life? No. But the food is extremely delicious and extremely reliable. I have loved everything I have had at Forno- especially the prosciutto arugula pizza, I get it almost every time!One thing I love about Forno is Forno Late Night. It's something so fun that not too many places do, but they have a menu from 11PM-1AM on Fridays and Saturdays. Its easy to find some food after the bar but not easy to find high quality food! If you're in Columbus and don't know where to go Forno is an amazing option."", ""I'd say this place is okay at best. I wasn't wowed. We had a late dinner on a Wednesday evening.

I love that they have gluten free bread as an option but it wasn't great. Sort of stale/hard actually. We got the prosciutto pizza with gluten free crust for dinner. A shareable size I'd say. It was good, but I did notice that the prosciutto was a little hard. By the time we were finished eating, the pizza was super soggy. We had two pieces left that we didn't even take, which I NEVER do, but knew it wouldn't keep. I did love the kiwi mule! It was super refreshing/tasty. Service was okay. Our waiter was nice, but not much energy from the staff in general. Ambiance was fun. Pretty busy for a Wednesday but think that's perks of Short North. I'd try Forno again. It was my first time.

Yum!Measures for covid were in place. Highly recommend!Update: April 10, 2020I returned from Cleveland to hit Press Grille for dinner. Quite the opposite experience from the first review. It\'s about 7pm and raining. My boyfriend and I see a guy standing outside the door talking on his cell phone. We go to pass him and head inside. He steps in front of us and abruptly says ""We are at capacity."" He continues with his phone conversation. We awkwardly stand there assuming most places offer to be added to a wait list. So after a moment, I ask how long the wait is or if we can be added to a list. He looks annoyed as if I\'m interrupting his call and goes inside to grab the list. He takes down the name and cell number. We head back across the street to the hotel we are staying at. At this point I assume I\'m never getting a call.About 20 minutes later I call and ask how long the wait it and was told ""we are at capacity. We don\'t give wait times."" I call a couple other places in Short North and most waits are about an hour. (Odd how other establishments are capable of estimating waits...) So assuming it\'s likely an hour wait, I can back shortly after 8pm. I explain we were in the list and wanted to see how much longer the wait would be. I can tell it\'s the same guy from the door by his voice. He checks the sheet and says ""I called you twice and it was busy."" I responded with it\'s a cell phone and it can\'t be busy. We weren\'t even on it."" He replies with ""sorry but I called myself so I know. "" He doesn\'t offer a solution just too bad for you... why not offer a table now or the wait shouldn\'t be much longer... nothing. Zero customer service. So to go from one end of the spectrum of top notch customer service to garbage in a month is so disappointing. The guy working the door on Saturday should have no contact with customers, ever. I would say it\'s easy to assume he has no vested interest in this business.']",positive
"[""This place is my savior during convention season. Whenever Dragon Con, MomoCon, and other cons are in the surrounding hotels, I make a point to go to Gyro King.First of all, I adore the owner.

I can get an affordable meal here at 2am instead of paying an arm and a leg at the Hard Rock Cafe or Hooters a few blocks away.

I've brought many friends here too, and we all love it.Now to the food. It's delicious. I'm simple. I like a lamb gyro, and it's always delicious whether it's the afternoon or the middle of the night. The fries are tossed in a scrumptious herb seasoning that is to die for when dipped in ranch sauce.The only downside is there's usually no where to sit. There's only a couple tables outside. I would suggest if with a big con like Dragon Con, maybe bring a few extra fold out chairs. After a long day of walking, its terrible having to carry my food all the way back to the hotel. I don't even care if there's a table. I just want a chair to sit on and eat my food.I love Gyro King. I will continue coming here as long as it's there.

Literally anything your order, food or drink is carefully crafted and has layers of flavor. The food menu is Asian inspired comfort food. Their Pork Buns had me drooling! The Mapo Bolognese was a great level of spice to make the dish interesting and tasting like nothing you've ever had before. The entrée meals can easily be shared by 2 people, or if you're like me and would rather have it all to yourself, enough to enjoy next day leftovers.

Being moderately hungry, I ordered the Malaysian fried rice. It came out hot and with the perfect combination of flavors. It was NOT spicy, but still tasty.2) Drinks: Enjoying more sweet drinks, I ordered the peach frose.

It had been several years since I dined here, and my fiancé had never been. We came for their social hour on a Sunday, which definitely offered some really great options. We just chose somewhat poorly. We tried the Margarita de Peached and the Big Breezy for drinks, and both were really good. I'm on my way to becoming a gin fan, and I found the Big Breezy to be really refreshing. For food, we started with the spicy pork fries--a solid choice! Definitely a generous portion and full of flavor. Where we went wrong, however, was following those up with the BP Social Burger. The description of it sounded so appetizing, but unfortunately it was really disappointing. It was dripping with grease, and the burger itself lacked flavor entirely. Sure, the toppings elevated it a bit, but the meat was so bland. It honestly was worse than a fast food burger in my opinion. We attempted to redeem our poor choice and ordered a banh mi taco, which helped a little. The meat was fresh and flavorful, and overall the taco was full of flavor; very similar to the flavors packed in the spicy pork fries. I would give Bar Peached another try and also recommend to others, as I know it's a reputable establishment and there were positives to be had in our experience. I would just strongly discourage the burger if you're wanting a worthwhile meal."", ""This place has impeccable vibes. We went on a Friday night, sat at the bar, and had dinner and drinks before a concert. The bar is not somewhere I usually prefer sitting but I loved it here. It was super intimate, the bartenders were good company, and the food was great. I believe I had fish tacos and they were super yummy and filling. Before we got seated, we ordered drinks in their outdoor area, and I loved that too. Looking at the pictures, the daytime ambience is different than at night, and while both look fun... I'd definitely recommend a nighttime visit here. Loved it."", 'The outdoor patio and incredible service brings fantastic vibes to bar peached!!

One was a curry beef dish. The garnishing of the food was poor. The rice was just thrown on the plate. No veggies on the side. The food was acceptable. The mixed fruit shaved ice was a joke.

They have tempura and noodles as well. The menu rolls taste fresh, and I dare say have the optimal quality of fish. On a yelp whim, I decided to try the ""Monkey Brains"", about as far from traditional sushi as you can travel. I tell you though, this dish was fun and decadent. They stuff a avocado with crab salad, tuna, and goodies. They then deep fry it with crispy panko. It is not greasy at all. The avacado is so creamy, but still holds up. Even though this was far from sushi, it was rich and delicious (pictured below).The Scallop Volcano roll that we love to order is creamy and tender, with bits of earthy chewy shitake mushroom mixed into the scallop salad.

You will see the same 4 or 5 types of sushi go by over and over. And what you gain in savings per plate, you lose in quantity. I have never seen sushi rolls made so small and cut so thin. Further, there is very little in the way of fish.

They mill about and converse with one another, chatting and failing to notice a customer until a few awkward seconds later. The tea tastes like hot water, and the portion for the free edamame is laughably tiny. I recommend against getting the agedashi tofu, because they make it with something odd. It's supposed to be crunchy and crisp on the outside, but these have almost a gelatinous texture. The sashimi slices, however, are large and incredibly fresh. (I personally really enjoyed the tuna tataki- it had nice, fat chunks swimming in a refreshing ponzu sauce.) As well, their rolls are creative and tasty. There's no need to dip it into soy sauce, as the rolls are well-seasoned and drizzled in their own special sauce. I appreciate the wide variety of choices they have, and I look forward to trying the rest of them! It's a lovely restaurant for a quick bite to eat.

Moe was the best and read our minds as he brought the peach cobbler we ordered in a to go package. The food is plentiful and impossible to eat in one sitting. We plan to return.', ""We hiked to eat fried chicken at Mary Macs because our friend and many helpers recommended MM. We were super excited, but ended up in a huge disappointment. I got the 3 thigh pieces... and the fried chicken looked so appetizing... but when I bit into it, it was underwhelming. The chicken was so dry, flavorless and Luke warm. Like it's been sitting out on the heater for quite some time. It was not fresh. No flavor. We did see hot sauce on everyone's table... maybe we messed up by not putting hot sauce? My collard greens were the best thing on my plate, it was salty which added some flavor to the chicken. The cornbread was dry as a desert. My southern squeeze was extremely sweet. I was thinking like sweetened lemonade and unsweetened tea but it was both sweet lemonade and sweet tea. My bad for assuming. It tasted good when I added a tiny bit to my water. Otherwise only for sweet tooth. The peach cobbler was the most enjoyable thing there.""]",positive

I'm from San Francisco, and finding a quality Chinese bakery with fair prices is hard to come by in Boston. Although Yi Soon isn't a match for the ones I grew up with (I'm biased), their pastries surely don't disappoint. I came here for the first time last week and got the red bean mochi bun ($1.75). I've never had mochi in a bun before, and I was surprised by how soft and fluffy it was! The bun itself is chewy and not artificial tasting. There was a lot more red bean filling than I expected--which I loved--and it wasn't too sweet either. The smooth mochi helped balance out the nuttiness and thickness of the red bean paste. And to top it all off, the crusted swirl added a fun texture to the whole experience! I dipped the bun in some Hong Kong instant milk tea at home and it was simply amazing.The woman behind the counter was very sweet.

This doesn't reflect their quality of food though.Highly recommend"", ""I am trying to find a good Asian bakery outside of Chinatown but have been unsuccessful thus far. I liked that all the bread at Yi Soon was wrapped, especially during COVID.

This bread was undercooked, quite bland, not fluffy/risen enough, and only has a few raisins in it.HK Style Custard Bread was the worst of the bunch with a tart lemony topping which overpowers the inner custard filling. This bread also did not rise and didn't taste like Asian bread at all. Tastes like store bought American bread with too much lemon that lingers in your mouth long after the bread is eaten."", 'All the bakery items were good. My favorite was the hot dog scallion bun. Second favorite definitely the coconut creme bun. I will definitely go back! Less than $10 for 4 items.', ""Super nice staff and great baked goods. The red bean mochi bun is always my go to whenever I stop by. It costs roughly $2. The red bean itself isn't too sweet and they put the right amount of mochi so that it isn't too chewy.

I usually go to Chinatown to get my pastries, but I find that Yi Soon is definitely comparable. Their style here is more on the modern side and I appreciate that they have labels and ingredients listed for everything. I love their sandwiches (the secret ingredient is the pork floss), chocolate mousse cake, and a sponge cake with light cream in the middle and chocolate coating on top. I also like their chocolate tiger-skin swiss roll slices and wish they sold them in a larger size. The only thing I wasn't a huge of was the coconut pudding. I imagined it to be bouncy and marshmallowy, but it's soft pudding squares coated in coconut flakes. The lady at the counter was nice.

There aren't any rice plates (save for fried rice, which is acceptable here) or lunch specials. Heck, they're not even open for lunch. Their appetizers are dreadful, especially the chicken wings. Get said wings from Big Boss just 100 feet away.However, the noodle dishes here are solid. The beef chow fun has good wok flavor to it, along with plenty of beef. The Singapore chow mai fun has curry flavor and the restaurant does not skimp on portion. The seafood pan-fried noodles is better than most places around, with a nice amount and selection of seafood (i.e. not cheap imitation crab meat).The lamb in clay pot isn't too bad, with a decent amount of lamb in there. The sauteed pea-pod stems are good, with it having a nice amount of garlic and not too much residual water. The sauteed geoduck clam is quite nice and a good alternative to conch.

Finally got their attention and put in our order, was told ""The chefs are still eating, you need to wait"". Well since when is that my problem? If you choose to open the restaurant while having a celebration dinner... shouldn\'t you have a least some chefs available for business?!

Meaning, seats are limited so order to go or have some patient. Service is like any Asian restaurants I've been to.

They try to be there for every table but if you need their attention, speak up. Don't hide in a turtle shell, the servers won't bite if you ask for something.Their food are the most authentic I have tried in the area and I enjoy coming here for family-style dined in. Food are a bit pricier compare to other Chinese restaurants nearby but also taste much better. I've never had an issue with the food being too salty, unless it's meant to taste salty. If you dined in, you will end your meal with a complimentary dessert soup of coconut, taro, and tapioca. Parking is limited as it is street parking only but if you're taking public transportation, it is right behind Wollaston T-station (red line, the door that leads to the streets instead of the big parking lot). They're not open during lunch hours but they're open late until 1AM so you have an option to either eat fast food or family style food for those late night hunger attacks.

"[""YUMMY, FUN and AMAZING! The end. But if you want to read more...Jen, Mark and Lo are so friendly, inviting and funny! As soon as you sit down, the conversations flows and instantly they make you feel like you're their friends from way back. The first time we came it was back in August when we went to Orlando for the weekend. We went on a Friday and they were doing a special event for friends and family to support their No Sneeze Guard petition. So it was a free event where they served you FREE, yes FREE sushi pieces, desserts, etc. I was amazed! We loved it so much that we made reservations for the next day (Saturday) and loved it so much on Saturday that we made reservations again for Sunday. I could eat omakase everyday!Each piece is skillfully made and the taste is delicious and seems so simple but it's so \xa0much more to it than just putting a piece of sliced fish on some rice. Overall each piece and plate just melts in your mouth. When we heard they were going to stop serving end of December 2015, we had to go back one more time. They were accommodating to fitting us in on a weekend that would work for my hubby and I and they were booked! They are going to look for a new place and hopefully open soon- I can't wait to get my omakase fix again soon! When they open their new place, you have to go check it out! Yummy yummy in my tummy approved!"", ""If I could give this place 6 stars, I would. Yelp really needs to add the 6th star for this restaurant.We found out about Kappo when we were researching dining options in Orlando, since we made a pretty last minute booking to Disneyworld. After reading all the wonderful reviews, we decided that we HAD to visit this place. Unfortunately, the online reservation system showed that the restaurant was fully booked till Dec. I decided to take a chance and begged for a reservation through email, since we were flying across the country. Fortunately, they were willing to accommodate us for a Sat 4pm seating for the sushi omakase. (Would have loved to go for dinner omakase instead, but that was fully booked)The restaurant is pretty small, in fact, it is literally a hole in the wall. They seat only about 7-8 people at the sushi bar counter, and you can watch the chefs prepare the food right in front of you, which just makes the experience that much better.We started off with a half dozen of oysters, 2 of each kind, all from the West Coast. There were 3 different types of accompaniment, which was quite a delight. This was followed up by a sashimi platter of trout, scallops, sea bream and ikura, all slightly seared and rubbed with a little yuzu pepper. We saw that they had a special king crab dish served with burgundy truffle in the ala-carte menu, and requested to try that. The dish was beautifully presented with the king crab meat sitting on top of the truffle sauce, topped with egg vinaigrette and shavings of black truffles. The combination was perfect and it made me want to lick the plate at the end. In fact, we both liked it so much, my boyfriend almost didnt want to share that last piece.Next up was the sushi, served piece by piece. We were given wet towels to wipe our hands, since it was recommended for us to use our hands for the sushi as using chopsticks would cause it to fall apart. As the sushi was being prepared, the conversations flowed. We had lion fish, sea bream, trout, scallop, king crab, lobster, salmon belly... I forgot to take a picture of the salmon belly sushi, and they happily made one more for me, just for the pictures. Of course I gobbled it down greedily :PWe chatted with Mark and Lo about food in San Francisco, and casually mentioned that we were disappointed that foie gras was banned in California. \xa0Following which, they served us a sushi with foie gras custard, uni and quail egg. This was totally orgasmic as we popped the sushi into our mouths. They also served us a foie gras terrine topped with sturgeon caviar. This was very very good too. We discussed how to make the foie gras terrine and this dish has definitely inspired us to retry making it again. In fact, they gave us some pink salt to bring home since it was needed to cure the foie. How thoughtful!Just as we were getting full, our final dish was an ikura handroll. In my opinion, this was the weakest dish in the entire omakase menu. Desserts were meant for a separate stomach, and we enjoyed a persimmon ice dessert topped with cream and walnuts. This was very light and refreshing. Great for cleansing the palate. We also had another plate of yuzu marshmellow (Very very light), matcha cake (served warm, and oh so good), mango something (sorry I can't pronounce the name)... kinda like a jelly thing, and the ultimate miso macaron. The surprising combination of savory umami and sweetness worked extremely well. It was so good we packed another 6 pcs home!The total bill came out to be $140+ for 2 people. It was well worth the price, and we were very very very happy with the experience. We even got 2 free onigiris to bring back. Mark, Lo and Jen were extremely friendly and the entire culture and atmosphere of the restaurant makes you feel very homey.. kinda like going to a friend's house for dinner. It was evident that they had many regular customers, since they greeted everyone like old friends and were super eager to feed everyone (sometimes even for free).If I were to be nitpicky, I'd say that there was too much seared fish. Perhaps it was because the fish were not as fresh as they'd liked it to be, so they tried to dress it a little? Or maybe they just wanted to be creative and go with the flow. To be clear, the fish here IS fresh. I'd have loved to have some plain nigiri sushi. But that's just me.They've only been open for 3 months, but I heard they've got the lease for 2 years in the incubator. I can't wait to see all the great things they come up with. I'm sure they'll be very successful wherever they go. I just wish that they'd preserve that culture and atmosphere as they continue to grow.Keep up the good work guys!! And definitely come visit SF bay! :)"", ""This place is a MUST-TRY in Orlando! One of the best dining experiences I've ever had! I recommend saving up before going to this place because it can get a little pricey and going on a weekday with no other plans in your day because the wait to eat there may be long. I went with friends and we got seated with a few other people and by the end of our meal we were all like one big family! If you're not big on interaction and company during a meal, this may not be the right place for you. The chefs are wonderful at what they do. Passionate & GREAT company. You may spend a lot of time there but time flies when you're having fun and time definitely flew by when I was there!There food is phenomenal. The sushi is fresh and pleasing to the palette. My personal favorite, the Chirashi bowl, is a good choice if you're adventurous and like different types of sashimi."", ""High quality 'Jiro Dreams of Sushi'-type sushi-- CHECK!I was blown away by this place. Everyday the menu of Japanese dishes changes and their prepackaged food is super fresh and delightful!I got the Aka Shiso (tuna maki) which included shiso greens from the East End Mkt garden. Lo let me know it is like a Japanese mint. It was so subtle and amazing! He also grated fresh wasabi for the dish. I have never had fresh wasabi and it was sweet and potent.We then went with the Ookii- a rice bowl of amazing fresh seafood and greens. It was presented beautifully and each slice of fish was lightly marinated in soy sauce so there was no need to add any extra. The fish on hand included salmon, coba, tuna, king crab (amazing and lemon-y!), and scallop slices that were charred. The dish also included perfectly cooked sushi rice that was so good I could have eaten it by itself.Then we moved on to dessert. Jen is the former pastry chef of a top London restaurant and it shows. This was worth going back for alone. We ordered the fruit plate. It included litchi, a litchi-like fruit that has long spikes, sliced citrus of some sort, blueberries (some are meticulously sliced in half), passion fruit, a lime sorbet, and more. Seriously- check out the picture!! It was a revelation.We also got the petit fours with tea. The petit fours came with an unbelievable miso caramel macaroon, a tiny and delicate yuzu marshmallow, and a truffle. The tea we chose was the hot Genmaicha tea. It was earthy and tasted of rice in the best way you can imagine. To top everything off we got the Maicha Milk Tea with soy milk. This is prepackaged and worth getting next time in at EEM. Cold, sweet, green, amazing!"", ""Finally got to try this little spot! My husband and I had a wait time of 2 hours when we arrived. We mostly strolled around the East End getting some coffee at Lineage and it ended up being the same day as the feedback fair. We ended up local roots for some drinks before we got sat down. We had a tough time choosing what to select but ended up doing the 8pc sushi omakase that comes with a soup a dessert. I ordered a matcha green milk tea which was delicious!They serve you each sushi piece one at a time. And each piece was as fresh and amazing as the last. I'm usually just a tuna person when it comes to sushi but here I had no problem what was being served. There was one piece I was not a fan of and that was uni which was my first time trying and its probably more of an acquired taste. I enjoyed the entire experience and would definitely come again!!"", ""Can you let someone else you've never met before make your food selections? If your answer is yes, this is the place for you. If not, maybe you'll change your mind after reading this. Kappo stands to change all the rules of dining in Orlando. No menu, no options, no substitution, no, no, no,....... just accept divine offerings and indulge.For centuries, highly acclaimed and well respected Japanese chefs have served the chosen few in tiny restaurants. The personal interaction and service from these master chefs is worth every ounce to an appreciative fan. This kind of dining is not for everyone. One has to be totally open minded and willing to try anything. Complete appreciation for ingredients and chef skills takes the frills out of dining. These restaurants seat just around a counter with hardly any other space. The walls sometimes act as chair backs. Decor is not a factor, one goes here for food and chef. That's it. No frills, no high pressure servers, no nose in the sir sommeliers, no corporate high clicker asking how was the food. None of that. Just honest to good food. This is Kappo.Their food takes cue from Japanese cuisine. It seems as though the chefs submit to ingredients rather than pulverize food into submission for personal interpretation. Very few ingredients are used to compliment or contrast a main ingredient. This allows for ingredients to shine all the way through. A simple cut of fish on top of rice with a drizzle of ponzu or soy burst with flavors that speak for themselves. The difference here, that cut of fish does not exist in any sushi restaurant in Orlando or that delicate balance of sushi rice dances ever so lightly. Only freshly grated wasabi root is used in preparation none of that green bitter tasting paste.Kappo is challenging Orlando diners to expand their palate and dining vision. Who said that there must be a sushi case, kimonos, Japanese bells, menu and everything in bamboo or ultra industrial modern or food that all taste the same? These young chefs put their training on display. Their food speaks for itself. The restaurant menu and style evolves every hour. Who knows what they are doing today or tomorrow. \xa0Every high profile chef started somewhere. If these young chefs continue at this level, we are experiencing the birth for something truly special. If you can open your mind to entertain a dining experience like no other in Orlando, go and submit to greatness in the making."", ""Kappo is a tiny little food stand in a small market and seats about 8 people at a time. So clearly, you have to time it accordingly if you don't wanna be stuck waiting forever to be seated. But it lives up to the hype!I was in town for the day so my bf and I wanted to try Kappo based on word of mouth. We went on a Thursday afternoon around 1 and only had to wait about 10 minutes for two seats to open up. I initially intended on getting the chirashi bowl but my bf wanted to try their omakase so I ultimately decided to join him. We each got the basic 10-piece omakase for about 40 bucks each. Keep in mind that you probably shouldn't order this if you're in a rush because it takes time for each part to come out. Every single course that came out was both delicious and a work of art from the sashimi to the nigiri. Each omakase also comes with a small soup and dessert, so I was perfectly satisfied by the end. I was hesitant at first because I have quite the voracious appetite and wasn't sure if I'd be full, but the 10-piece omakase actually comes with a lot more than I expected.The staff is so friendly and we had a great conversation with our chef, Lo, throughout our entire lunch. They even shared their staff lunch with us (which was quite good as well)! If I had the money and lived in the area, I could easily see myself coming here every week. I've done the omakase at other restaurants before, but you can tell Kappo really takes pride in their quality and individuality while maintaining a flawless authenticity. And I know my Japanese food since it's by far my favorite cuisine. Their menu changes all the time, so no experience is like the last. Which is precisely why I've been dying to go back to try other things they come up with. Outside of their great tea selection, even their drinks sound intriguing! Matcha soda? Should've tried it when I had the chance! Why must I live so far?!"", ""It's taken months to get a spot to dine at Kappo in the East End Market. Mostly because I tried a few times then gave up, like most do. I wonder if Alton Brown had this much trouble.Thanks to my foodie friend Kristin, I was able to get in on a Sunday for a late lunch after months of drooling over other people's pictures and envying their rave reviews. If you work full-time, finding a spot available on the weekends to dine can be quite a feat. Not to mention a splurge. $60 on lunch per person seems a bit insane, but the experience was worth the price tag.We arrived at 2:00 pm for our reservation but ended up having to wait until 2:30 to be sat. Pro for diners, you aren't rushed out, con if it's your turn you might be waiting with a stomach making velociraptor noises and scaring the people in line for coffee at Lineage.We hovered closely as we waited our turn and once the time came we saw bright, shining, elated faces emerge from behind the sheer curtain. People literally walked through us as though they were drunk on food. \xa0Side note: Why hasn't Weird Al come out with a Beyonce parody of Drunk in Love to Drunk on Food. Get on that Al!We did not wait long for our first course (out of 6) which was an appetizer plate filled with goodies.Seared scallops with turnip pureeFoie gras with foamed radishes and rice crackerSashimi - Salmon and another fish I did not jot down. (I know for shame)Oyster with Rutabaga pureeYou will have to forgive my descriptions. They rattle off all the ingredients of each dish, but I certainly did not catch every item nor could I spell them all properly. \xa0I also didn't want to distract from the experience by continually asking as I typed furiously on my phone before eating each dish. Sometimes it's better to just eat and enjoy. \xa0I would actually love it if they produced menu cards with all the ingredients and where they source them from, especially since everything is as local as possible. \xa0What seemed to be the item from furthest away was still in Key West.Back to the food, although I'm not normally a fan of Oysters and Foie Gras, that didn't stop me from devouring each item on my plate. The Salmon was most assuredly the best I've had. It was as smooth as butter. \xa0I also noticed they give you a very small amount of soy sauce, and I'm sure they do that because this fish is so good it doesn't need much else accompanying it.It's best to note that on Sunday's at Kappo, you are seated to enjoy the courses presented to you. You have no say in what you eat. So if you are not adventurous or have many food allergies to worry about this is probably not the place for you to settle in for two hours.The next course was a Miso Soup with shellfish & mushrooms. They gave it a really nice foam and it was delicious! Unlike anything I've ever had.Next up was what could have possibly been a dessert course, but was more of a palate cleanser. Fennel, strawberry, Rutabaga with a little tempura.This dish was great because it was light, had sweetness from the local strawberries, but the tempura gave it such a nice crunchy salty flavor.Next was Sweetbreads. \xa0They were delicious, although I immediately thought of what Sweetbreads actually are and was mildly hesitant. To my delight they were really just like little fried balls of protein with nice flavor, and not all were Sweetbreads, there were some scallops in there as well, along with a nice cucumber pickle puree and tomatoes. Phew!Our last course was a simple dish of seared fresh Salmon on a bed of steamed white rice. It was presented to us, but we were told to wait until one of the chefs came by with a broth that he poured in each of our bowls.You would think this simple dish wouldn't pack the flavor punch that it did. That' why these people at Kappo are legit. \xa0Even the simplest dishes are powerful.We were treated to a final dessert course of Matcha ice cream with a Macaroon and strawberries. Again, simple yet so amazing and the perfect end to great dining experience.I would definitely say that Kappo lived up to the hype. \xa0For me, it's more of a treat yo'self meal for special occasions, but I've been told the lunch menu is more wallet friendly and easier to get a seat.Alas if you are looking to book your reservations, the Kappo team is headed back to Japan for the month of March for some R&D, so you will have to wait a little bit longer to get in on this great experience."", ""I AM IN LOVE.My boyfriend fed me Kappo's Sushi Omakase on my birthday and now I wish it's my birthday everyday. I love the atmosphere and the quality service here. The chefs creates pieces individually for you while you melt away in happiness. I've been dying to try an omakase and decided that Kappo would be the place to do it and I don't regret my choice. Sadly, they only do it during the lunch hours and it's RSVP for group parties for dinner. Since it was the two of us we couldn't get any dinner omakase set up, but it's okay. The lunch sushi omakase is just as good!Each piece I put in my mouth was delicious. From the tea down to the dessert. This is delicious high quality fish. It makes me happy just thinking about it. I totally recommend Kappo to everyone! It's a great experience just to try, but I'll come back... multiple times!"", ""Kappo provides a pleasantly personal and intimate dining experience with authentic sushi that you won't be able to find anywhere else especially priced so reasonably at $60 for their Magical Mystery Tour which is a 12 pc daily changing sushi set that comes with dessert and a soup. \xa0The three chefs, Mark, Lo, and Jen, \xa0take you on this magical tour are friendly, personable, and just masters of their craft. \xa0Make sure you make reservations ahead of time as there are only 8 seats and they fill up quick! \xa0I was lucky enough to get a 3:00pm seating and had one of the best dining experiences of my life. \xa0Their fish is amazingly fresh and sliced perfectly and you get to watch the chef prepare it all right in front of you. \xa0My favorite was the seared salmon. \xa0So perfectly done and fresh! \xa0It's incredible how one can work a sushi knife as their primary tool of food art. \xa0I also came to learn that they're friends with the Naoe Miami folks right in my backyard! \xa0Small world! \xa0Their Foie Gras was also a big hit with my taste buds! I would expect this type of quality and freshness in Tokyo, but Orlando?! \xa0This tiny 8 seater has changed the game for the state of Florida. \xa0I don't think there is any place like it and if there is, it's most likely going to cost you an arm and a leg. \xa0Do yourself a favor and try Kappo out for yourself. \xa0But picky eaters beware: this is not your california roll type of place you're used to!""]",positive
"['Would I return - MaybeI preface this by stating I am not a huge seafood fan. \xa0I found the meals to be a tad pricey for the amount and quality of food served. \xa0The restaurant was less than half full and the service was just okay. \xa0I thought the lobster came out a bit greasy but I did like the grits that came with it. \xa0I find this to better than Red Lobster but not my favorite place.', ""It was close to the hotel, the lights were on and I really didn't feel like driving another hundred yards. So I popped into this very chain restaurant for dinner. I don't know why I did it - I don't really care for crabs or lobster or any other kind of shellfish. But you can't go to a seafood place and have a steak, can you?My waitress eventually came around to my table and took my drink order (no mid-week beer specials) and by the time she arrived with my Red Stripe, I had settled (really, I settled) on the grilled shore platter, which is a mahi mahi filet, some bacon-wrapped shrimp, a pot of mashed potatoes with cheese on top and an ear of grilled corn. The fish was decent, the shrimp were bacony, the potatoes were volcanic hot and the corn was excellent.Service was kind of meh, as she seemed to be busy taking care of some friends at a table on the patio. She seemed disappointed that I didn't want to drink more beers.It was a chain. It was okay. I've had better."", ""Great place. Good atmosphere. Even has a playground for the kids! The food was awesome however our waitress was terrible. It took 15 minutes for her to notice us after we were sat down and another 15 for her to take a drink order.

A friend and I had been here a year ago for lunch and it was just terrible. We figured we had just ordered the wrong thing (the crab bisque tasted like the cheap cheese you find in those vending machine cheese crackers.) This past July on a Sunday we were craving crab so we decided to give it another shot.First of all, they put this big metal bucket in front of you. It was quite annoying so we moved it so we could see each other to talk. The server kept moving it back to the middle of the table blocking our view of each other. Didn\'t care for that.We both ordered the Bucket of Snow Crab. Comes with potatoes and corn on the cob. It was SO SALTY. If you could die from an overdose of salt this would do it for sure. The amount of salt was so unbelievable we couldn\'t even finish half of it. That\'s a shame, those crab buckets aren\'t cheap.We made sure to put the crab cracker and the other silverware on the outside of the bucket so they wouldn\'t accidentally throw it out but we got yelled at for putting it in the bucket. Uh, huh? Then the server proceeded to talk way too long about how people always put the crackers in the bucket and they get thrown out and as a result they are short on crackers and silverware. OK- We thought of that beforehand, that\'s why we made sure to put them where they could be easily seen. She also told us that the ""Secret Shoppers"" were coming soon and they didn\'t have enough silverware. We ordered two drinks, the Rum Barrel LIT and the Red Raspberry Palmer. Both come in glasses that you can keep. The Rum Barrel in the Tiki glass was good, the Palmer was meh. My friend didn\'t like that one at all. The strength of the drinks was ok, not too strong, not too weak.The place could also have been a bit cleaner. The service was quite slow even though there were not many customers. One customer was dining without a shirt on, which surprised us. Little too casual if you ask me. Very expensive for such disappointing food and service.This place, the food and the service deserve NO stars.', 'Visiting from Virginia, used to come often with children and grad child when we lived here 10 years ago. \xa0Tonight was intended to be a chance to reminisce at old stomping ground with even more family. \xa0Poor service, food took almost one hour to arrive, and was incorrect when it did arrive, leading to some eating while others had to wait. The queen crab was poorly steamed as well. Had to return a bottle of root beer that the waitress delivered to my grandson...the entire top was broken off and jagged. Bad service, delayed and poor food, and the broken beverage bottle speak to a clear decline of quality at this location.', ""I haven't been in this place in over 10 years.... Unfortunately, this place is going down the hill. The food is salty and the service is terrible. No, no, no, just NO to this place."", 'My wife wanted to go here for her birthday, and I invited several of her friends as a surprise for her. I called ahead the day before to make the reservation and told the hostess it was going to be a surprise and not to set the table up for all 19 people at the start (we could push more tables together as folks arrived). She said this would be no problem, but when we got there, the hostess working that day (not the same woman) grabbed 19 menus and took us to a giant table they\'d assembled. Surprise blown; we\'re off to a bad start.The food took a long time (at least thirty minutes, probably more) to arrive, and several members of our party reported that it was lousy when it finally did. Our waiter was polite and friendly but seemed to forget or ignore many requests quickly after we made them. While he took care of drink refills promptly, things like utensils, extra plates, and condiments took several reminders before they were brought. One fellow ordered crab, and after it arrived he was told that crab crackers were not available, which seems pretty unforgiveable for a restaurant with ""crab"" in its name. We had to ask the waiter multiple times for a to-go box, and a birthday celebration that I requested (singing and general embarrassment that these sort of chains like to do) never materialized after he told me he would make it happen. Of course with so many members of our party dissatisfied, there were complications with the checks as well, as the waiter and management did not seem to communicate about what would be comped on account of the poor service. One group left the restaurant thinking they had settled what they owed, but the waiter disagreed and asked us to chase them down in the parking lot and deliver the remainder of the bill.We have eaten here before in small parties and had good experiences, so we really didn\'t expect such an amateur hour when it came to a bigger event. Unfortunately, on this occasion their pleasant attitude was overshadowed by rank incompetence.Unrelated to the meal:The restaurant has a fenced-in playground adjacent to their outdoor seating, which is really nice and helped the five small children in our group pass the time during the long wait for food. However, I noticed an active bees\' nest under the perimeter fencing of the playground. I told the hostess, who said she would tell the manager and he would get it taken care of. Thirty minutes later, I saw the manager and asked him if he got the message about the bees\' nest, and he said he did and he would have someone take care of it right away. When we left the restaurant (over an hour after I had originally reported the nest), it was still there. Thankfully none of the children playing was stung.', 'Not impressed with the staff at all!! \xa0The manager really need to pull the staff together. Not greeted when we came in. Our waitress was pleasant enough she just needs to learn to multi task. \xa0After finishing our meal which I have to admit was pretty good (red fish) we sat and waited and waited for a bill. \xa0Even after advising our waitress we were ready to pay the bill and leave we were still kept waiting.I restaurant looked dingy and dirty. \xa0I would not recommend this restaurant unless they improve tremendously!']",negative

It arrived with a layer of great looking fries below a tower of cornbread, brisket and two easy over eggs hanging on for dear life on top. Sorry should have taken a picture but over all this wonderful stuff was poured a large ladle of BBQ sauce that drenched everything. Now I like BBQ sauce but not necessarily over my eggs, brisket, cornbread and fries. Fries were shoestring and really tasty. The brisket was wonderful! The cornbread was excellent! The eggs were perfectly cooked and delicious! Too bad they were all smothered in BBQ sauce. I tried to explain to our waitress when she asked if I wanted to take away my remaining soggy fries that I would have preferred a deconstructed version of this meal but that didn't appear to be something she wanted to tell the chef so here I am explaining to you what I would have liked for a meal here. Menu looks great but be careful if you order this."", ""Got the trucker breakfast and everything tasted great. Eggs were medium-poached perfectly. Pancakes were fluffy and soft.

I got to dine in at their newly opened location today, and it was such a lovely experience. Due to COVID-19, the restaurant allows a maximum of one hour for each table to stick around. But because of the efficient service, this is more than enough time to enjoy your food. The staff were all extremely friendly and chipper, and it made for a positive service experience. The food - although the portions aren't super big, the flavours are spot on. We tried the daily special, which was an Italian sausage eggs benedict with basil hollandaise. I think there was also a sweet, tangy tomato jam spread on the English muffin.

The portion was large but I barely ate 1/4 of it. The fried portion/ breading was overdone/ slightly burnt on EVERY SINGLE PIECE!! The meat was dry which is hard to do with pork.

I sometimes will forego the karaage and get this instead to still give me my fill of fried goodness!

I usually have to be in the mood for this when I get it.Chicken Karaage (3/5): I say three stars but probably will still continue to order it. It doesn't really compare to true karaage I've had, more just like little chicken nuggets. They are small pieces and doesn't have the nice batter I love on karaage! Still good though, because how can you really go wrong with fried chicken? Service is always incredibly friendly and quick. The food has always been pretty consistent with the exception of two times where the soft-boiled eggs in the ramen were completely cold in the middle.

Unfortunately, by the time I made it to Portland the jazz clubs closed due to the pandemic. I am not sorry I ended up here though. The drinks were very reasonable and the layout is perfect. If I were to open my own bar or lounge one day, this is the design I'd want. You walk in and there are French doors leading to a bar and a set of stairs leading to the music. All live shows are downstairs. Through the French doors is the bar, lots of tables and cute intimate booths, on the other side there are more private areas for talking and an outdoor patio and restrooms. It's literally a place to listen to music and once you've had enough there is a place to go to chill and have a conversation.

One night, my white female friend and I decided to go out and Paint the Town Red. She wore all black clothing and I wore my best Blue Jeans and a great looking blouse. It was early Springtime. She and I went to a Concert at Doug Fir Lounge. It was 2006 in May when we went. The group we went to listen to is named "" Cloud Cult. "" My female friend wanted to go Dancing and then when I realized the she couldn\'t hear me over the performers we went for a Walk. I didn\'t know she didn\'t own a car. She and I arrived separately to Doug Fir Lounge that Night. We both lived in Downtown Portland, Oregon. I guess you could say she was my Best Friend or "" Bestie. "" She took the Bus to a nearby Bus Stop... I walked from Downtown. She and I left early... as we both had appointment early the next morning. There was a Patio Area outside that was fenced in... and my white female friend stopped to talk with some other white women about the Show and what Drinks they were consuming. Those other white women were from Out of Town. Holy Cow,... was it LOUD inside the Concert Venue for that night\'s Concert. Also, I told my Best Friend to drink her drink so we could get the Heck Out of There... because she looked like she was Not having as much fun as certain people who were in attendance while we were at the Concert. She was a little Tipsy when we left Doug Fir Lounge... I suggested that we walk over the Burnside Bridge... and I made sure she got to her Apartment safely that night. Oh yes, in case you were wondering... my Best Friend died a few years ago... I found out one afternoon a few weeks before her Birthday week. She died young.

This is my \xa0new spot when I do work in Vancouver, WA. Will be back.', 'I reserved a table for 14 at 7pm on a Friday evening, probably one of the most beautiful February days we\'ve had in the PNW ever. Our family had come in from all over to celebrate my mom\'s 70th birthday and we chose Hudson\'s because we trusted they could manage the production of a 14 top; and I must tell you that they managed it beautifully! We were seated upstairs and felt like we had the privacy to really enjoy our time together without disturbing other patrons. Our server was Brittany, and she was absolutely amazing at her job! She communicated well, she remembered everything we requested, and she was always available while remaining in the background. For as many people as we had, I was impressed with the timing of all that we ordered; We all had drink orders, we had calamari and flatbread appetizers, and our main courses were almost all forms of protein that must be timed well in order to be cooked to perfection. The kitchen backed up Brittany\'s serving, and the whole restaurant showed up as the star player in this production! Thank you so much for all of the work you put into ensuring we had the most wonderful family night filled with new memories:)Three complaints:1. There was a female hostess - I wish I\'d gotten her name - who wouldn\'t look at me or acknowledge me when I walked up to the hosting booth, until she finally looked up to say, ""I\'ll be right back."" No smile, hello, I\'ll be right with you, none of that...just three awkward minutes of me smiling, trying to grab her attention, wondering what was happening and why she wasn\'t acknowledging me.2. The wagyu beef burger my daughter ordered was charred and had the heaviness of a hockey puck. It may be that\'s how this restaurant cooks their wagyu burger, but we\'re used to silky, juicy, and tender.3. I ordered a tall greyhound and the pour was heavy; I like to order my drinks tall because I\'m trying to ""water down"" the alcohol with extra juice, and it does sometime happen that I end up with a double vs a tall, which is what this tasted like.None of these things dissuaded my five star review; the ambience, staff, and food is getting a standing ovation from our group for the excellent evening - thank you all so much! I hope your manager shares this with all of you so that you know your hard work behind the scenes did not go unnoticed; in fact, without your efforts we would not have had this most amazing memory to carry with us forever. Thank you again!', 'Once again, Hudson\'s has failed to deliver that once great quality continuity it has been known for. Ten years of loyal customer patronage, but last night was THE LAST NIGHT we will ever eat there. Nothing earth shaking, and that goes for the good as well as the bad.Had the Halibut, wife had the Salmon, hers was served with beets that seemed to be pulled right from the dirt and then cooked in the same dirt, dry, fibrous, cooked with as little imagination as possible. Beets take a certain amount of care to cook to perfection, butter comes to mind, as well as wine simmering, we can do better at home in our kitchen so...Our server was told about the inedible Beets, he then came back with the Beet;s unsavory cousins, some of the worst Asparagus ever to be served, huge tough stalks, no discernible flavors, and worse, he announced, ""this is on me.""Tried the happy hour burger a few months ago, far different than the past burger that stood heads above the Cove standard, the ""new"" burger is a fast food look alike and denigrates Hudson\'s reputation to the basement. Better to just drop an item rather than opting to disguise a Carl\'s Jr low ball presentation. I\'m hopeful that the new Thirteen Coins will alert the Couve to good food at good prices, Hudson\'s will either step up or go down as just another failed attempt to cook great food. I get it that the hospitality sector has been hard hit, but that\'s no reason to climb onto the loyal patrons dining table and hang oneself with tacky cooking strategies designed to save a buck. \xa0As a footnote: Most really caring restaurants will have some very real oversight on the cooking side, TASTING, yes that\'s not a new concept but it allows the Chefs to be able to share in the patrons misery--OR delight.', ""Came here for the second time and I ordered the same food.

I stayed at the lodge at the beginning of covid and the restaurant only had a few select items for delivery.Most recent we went in for the Dine in the Couv month. I\'ve had their fish, wagyu hamburger and fries, and risotto. All on par!

"['I must say, when I first tried 180 Xurros a couple of months after they first opened their doors I was a little overwhelmed by the potential of waiting in the massive line that snaked from the doors on NE Broadway. I was not looking forward to the potential of lackluster fried treats like those from Voodoo Donuts. However, we stuck it out, stood through it, and were not disappointed!The Xurros were delicious, both the original style and the stuffed. The drinking chocolate was absurdly good, so much so that we went back for a second round. The most surprising part was that the wait time was much shorter than expected! We only waited about ten minutes, both in line and to be served our goods! And boy were they good! I have definitely been back on several occasions and always recommend them to my friends.', ""Delicious churros made to order!!! I love how everything is made to order and you can watch them make it as well! This place cares about the finished products they give you. They make sure to take the time and attention needed to give you the best xurros! If the xurro isn't in the perfect circular shape as they make them, they put those on a side and toss it at the end. If you check-in on Yelp, you will get 3 free classic xurros!! They tasted amazing, they were soft and warm! I didn't see the dipping sauces the bottom of the menu... I must try it next time!!"", ""If you're craving some kind of desserts, then check out 180 Xurros! If you had churros before, you know they are a delight to munch on as a sweet treat. The churros here are fancier and pricier than the usual ones found in a Mexican bakery so don't be surprised when you see the bill (it's still not crazy expensive).We had the cinnamon churros with marshmallow dip. The dip was so delicious and addicting! The churros were lightly coated with sugar and crunchy to eat. It was hard sharing this one dish with two people 'cause we went at it and finished it quickly. Plus, the churros were small especially compared to the churros I'm used to.

Sure you could bin this in the hipster category, but frankly, who cares? Churros in Los Angeles or Tijuana off of a cart taste the same. The dipping sauces are a great accompaniment to the raindrop churros. We got the toasted marshmallow and mexican hot chocolate (House Xocolata) - I recommend getting the Xocolata since its a typical accompaniment to churros.The churro itself is crunchy, has a nice bark on the outside yet a doughy interior, and is not overly sweet. This is a nice alternative to the donut and ice cream shops around town.', 'My team and I came to this place from Seattle because we\'d heard the best things!

I recommend the lemon curd dipping sauce, it was the perfect amount of tartness which complements the sugar/cinnamon - I was honestly just eating the sauce on its own at some point.

But they decorate it beautifully and have an outside as well. Drinks/cocktails were amazing. Skipped appetizers and went right to entrees which I'm happy about because portions are huge.

I remember ordering a cocktail from the menu I didn't care for and the lobster fried rice which was also nothing to write home about. Talking about the best Thai restaurants in Atlanta with a coworker recently had me wanting to revisit this restaurant. I made a reservation one day prior which is HIGHLY recommended. Only 5PM and 9PM were available. I chose the latter to avoid traffic qualms and lack of parking. Parking options are complimentary valet and luckily the valet attendant takes cashless tips because it's Midtown. The place was PACKED. Yes at 9PM! I was seated right away. This place is also very LOUD. I highly recommend dining on the patio with fresh air and a less loud (can't really say quieter) environment. Better for those doing date night. A lot of couples were in the building surprisingly. I'm still trying to wrap my head around that. Some dining in small groups of 3-4. I was in for a treat because I was told by my waitress that Calvin himself was in the kitchen!On to the food:AMAZING WOULD ORDER THESE AGAIN1) Lobster and shrimp wontons- delicious, fried wontons you get three and it's topped with caviar and some glaze sauce. 2) Massaman curry appetizer with roti- one chicken drumstick in an extremely flavorful and good sized portion of the sauce and two hot, soft roti pancakes. It was so good I would take this in a bigger portion as a dinner entree3) the cocktail menu didn't excite me but I ordered an amaretto sour that was so good I got two and the price was great $8 apiece, served in a small cup with a big square block of ice and there is a liquor tax added GOOD BUT WOULDN'T ORDER AGAIN1) lobster and shrimp pad Thai- this is probably best to eat when it comes out of the kitchen, I had to tell my waitress Louise to pack my remaining items to go (which were the pad Thai entree and the lobster Mac and cheese appetizer). The sauce was good. I had asked for it spicy and waitress told me she could bring a side of Thai chili but it was not packed. Also my half lobster tail was not packed either. Will update this review with the restaurant's response once I call them later today during business hours 2) lobster Mac and cheese- not your typical creamy lobster Mac and cheese, lobster served in small bite sized chunks throughout three types of pasta and five types of cheeses (from how the waitress explained the dish to me). It is served more like a non-creamy pasta dish as opposed to a traditional Mac and cheese dish if that makes sense. The pasta types were bow tie, penne and I can't remember the third type of pasta. I tasted a hint of curry paste in it. 3) seafood spring rolls- not bad, fried roll, filling was stuffed with seafood (calamari, shrimp, lobster and something else I forgot), thin rice paper wrapping which I generally prefer but this one didn't wow me Gratuity is automatically added 19% no matter the amount in your party because I dined solo and I saw it was automatically added when I got the check. Luckily service was good aside from my lobster tail being forgotten."", ""We had an 8pm reservation on a Saturday night and arrived on time; unfortunately we weren't seated until almost 8:30 and it was very cramped trying to find a place a stand.

We started with the lobster wontons, and they were full of flavor. Creamy, crisp, savory, and tart all in one due to the combo of sauces. While having our appetizer, actor KEVIN BACON was seated at the table right next to us. Talk about a memorable experience!!! Our waitress said that famous people stop in often! Amazing! For dinner we had the sweet and sour duck and shrimp (loved this dish!), and the crispy beef, also fantastic. These were huge portions for the money, btw.We ordered dessert to go, the Suspension cake, which was creamy, fresh, and delicious, but there were definitely other desserts on the menu I would've preferred to try had we dined in (2 were served a la mode).

It very dim lighting so you can't really tell what's in the lobster fried rice. (I understand the ambiance of it.) The portions are really large. Enough for Leftovers. I don't think we will be back to visit. The suspension came was AHMAZING!!"", ""My long awaited review of Poor Calvin's. Finally! \xa0Make reservations if you can, this place gets packed and busy. They offer complimentary valet parking or free street parking, just watch out for signs for no parking areas. The vibes here were great from start to finish. I came in with a friend for dinner. We grabbed drinks and food, and did not feel rushed to get out of there. The cocktails were beautifully presented. Our server, Jenny, was very informative on what recommendations we should have. The portions for entrees were huge! Save some for your lunch for the next day or even a late night snack in a few hours. For drinks, I got the Frankly My Dear cocktail. I believe it was gin based, pretty light on the alcohol for any light drinkers, just like myself. My friend got the Long Island Tiki which was presented nicely and was pricey, however you do get a good amount for what you're paying for. For appetizers we got the fried calamari, the lobster wontons, and a single serve portion of tom yum soup. Honestly if you order a bunch of appetizers and make it tapas style, I think you would get full. I could barely finish my entree of lobster fried rice, which was delicious. Of course they will gladly pack it up to go for you. The food was great and I would come again. Service was also great too!"", 'Y\'all..don\'t need to feel sorry for ""poor"" Calvin, because his restaurant is absolutely ahh-mazing!! Chef Calvin Phan\'s take on asian food staples combined with classical southern dishes is the fusion you never knew you needed.The lobster wontons (his take on the crab rangoon), lobster mac and cheese (made with several different cheeses and types of pasta), and the salmon bites (battered and fried), were all great options to start out the night. The waitress highly recommended trying out the lobster fried rice, which was Calvin\'s winning dish on the food network, but Calvin\'s portions BE so BIG, that they would have to carry your stuffed-tail out of the restaurant by the end of your meal.The Inside decor of the restaurant is absolutely stunning and stylish. I particularly enjoyed the interplay between the different hues of blues, neutrals, and metal tones.My beverage of choice, which was soooo good and refreshing, but sneakily strong was called The Secret Garden.

Its chef Calvin\'s take on the French 75.And finally, as your prize for reading my yelpilcious review: here\'s a little tip if you ever decide to dine at Poor Calvin\'s...Calvin will hook you up with a complimentary uber ride to any location within the immediate downtown area after dining :) so cheers to him!Overall, an absolute must-try if you\'re ever in the ATL!!']",positive

I got the medium combo, with half spicy and half soy garlic flavors. They were both very sweet, I think sweeter than Bonchon, but I liked the spicy chicken more than the non spicy. It was also not as crispy/crunchy as other places. The soondubu was really good, I liked it better than the chicken. It was so good for a cold night. There was little tiny shrimp in it, I've never had shrimp in my soondubu before. Is it supposed to be like that? I don't know, but I liked the dish overall. Also got the jalapeno bomb appetizer, that was really good too. I liked the combination of the jalapeno, spicy mayo, eel sauce, and crab meat.I thought the food was a bit expensive. There's also a 3% kitchen appreciation charge."", ""Update: Updating to 1 star because my friend called after our meal & said they suspect this place gave them food poisoning that night. They think the culprit was their appetizer that had raw fish and veggies. That's the only thing they'd eaten all evening besides the chicken we shared. They also reminded me how they noticed we were missing a side item during our meal, and pointing this out was met with attitude by the server. This place isn't worth the stress and upset stomach!1/18: I guess we came on a bad day because our group received awful service for no reason. The hostess didn't greet us properly, and the server was forgetful and snarky when politely asked about our order. I got zero refills on water and the wrong entree. The chicken was alright but nothing to write home about. Additionally, my friend says they never answer the phone, so keep that in mind before ordering takeout."", ""Korean fried chicken is, hands down, one of my favorite foods! Crave definitely doesn't disappoint! We came on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. There weren't a lot of people here during that time - this is definitely more of a dinner place. We ordered the crispy shrimp shumai and soy garlic boneless fried chicken to share. The shumai was delicious - I loved the crispy skin and the flavorful shrimp filling. Since I had to share with 2 other people, I only got 2 pieces - I was tempted to get another order just for myself! The soy garlic chicken was SO yummy! The outside was so light, crispy, and insanely flavorful! The chicken, itself, was a bit bland. But the flavored batter makes up for it.

The pick up process was not-so-fun chaos, no real line many people trying to get to the front. Wish that was more organized. Food was soggy and cold which means the pick up time they gave us wasn't very accurate. After a few minutes in the air fryer, we were ready to eat...we ordered a 16 piece wings and drumstick combo and truffle fries. You get a choice of six sauces- we chose their spiciest and the garlic soy (mild spice). We only got ONE banchan- no daikon or kimchi. That was disappointing. The soy garlic tasted like nothing- skin was crispy. The spicy tasty had good flavor, but was more mild than I expected. The wings and drumsticks were all on the small size. Truffle fries were the highlight- weird. All this for $40 bucks- which i didn't think was a good value. I recently ordered a family combo at Bonchon (a chain yes- but a tasty one!) that was similarly priced with more chicken and sides plus fried rice. I might just wait until post-pandemic to hit up Crave again!"", ""I got the Soy garlic Chicken wings. Pretty classic and common option. Really good! For $12 you get quite a bit of food.I'd say the food still tasted pretty fresh even after I walked home with it.

In my 6+ years in restaurants, \xa0I never experienced such a service. Ordered on ubereats for pickup and went to pick up my food. The lady says they lost my ticket and my food was never made.

Walk over and say the food will be higher price even though they never updated their Uber app. Say I can pay full for all the stuff I order now and next time get free meal. How is it a customer fault with no recognition in the first place. I waited so long and travel far. I left so frustrated and contacted ubereats to cancel my order.

But that quality really comes out in every bite - very flavorful, well crafted menu items that are a joy to eat. If anything, I advise going with a few friends and splitting as much of the menu as you can different ways so that you can sample a bit of everything.In order of what I liked:1. Pork Belly Slider - there\'s a really big chunk of pork belly in there and since its the 3 little pigs, guess it makes sense to try it. This doesn\'t disappoint. The pork belly is incredibly flavorful and tender (yet holds together and has a crisped sheen). I like the apple slices that compliment the pork - at first I thought it was pickles but that hint of sweetness and tartness helps the richness.2. Crackling Meatloaf - at first my friends were unimpressed, but as I kept eating it, this is comfort food at its finest. Blackened meatloaf wrapped in bacon with bacon greens and grits. Yum. It\'s soft and delicate on the inside with a moistness that contrasts the charred exterior. Excellent.3. Stir Fried Pork Belly and Mushrooms - First bite of the pork is mind blowing - its effectively twice cooked pork modernized in chunkier form. The mushrooms add a good earthiness as well as with the black bean? sauce all over a fried noodle cake, all topped with a fried egg. I wish it was the flat rice noodles instead of the wavy but all in all a great take on modern ""chinese"" food for what it is. Does get a bit salty as the sauce collects on the bottom just fyi.4. Asian Fried Chicken - think karaage with some good sauces for a balance of sweet and spicy. It\'s really juicy and crisp. The slaw is a great palate cleanser and offers its own hints of sesame. I normally hate slaw, but it\'s pretty up there.That said I wish they had a back entrance as I don\'t like waking through the Aristocrat to get there, but oh well, can always get to go.', ""OMG....this is only the MOST SUPER AWESOME, CRAZY AMAZING food truck ever! I've always loved visiting Austin, and this place just seals the deal for me. I wish I lived here so I could come eat whenever. It's so good that one of my crazy friends will actually fly through Austin in his travels, stop to eat at Three Little Pigs, and then go back to the airport and fly out to his final destination. But it's totally worth it. He's actually still mad at me today, because when we went \xa0together for the first time, I totally hogged the Asian fried chicken. Couldn't help it though, it was just calling my name, and at the paltry price tag of $7, it's not like we couldn't have ordered another one, right?Anyways, as everyone else here has already mentioned, the pork belly slider is also wonderful. I can't say enough good things about this place. So put this on your itinerary, pick up a bottle of wine from the place next door, and pig out, pun intended!"", ""Hard to find but worth it.

Especially when you compare them with other food options in the park.Tortilla chips are also a nice touch, though a lot of them were rather soggy and you don't really get tortilla chips because they're soft.

The food wasn\'t bad, but I expected more. \xa0More presentation, more flavor, especially for $10.50 and $11.50. \xa0I did not try the lasagna, as it looked disgusting, but my girlfriend wants me to mention that the cheese was \'rubbery\'. \xa0When I got to work on Monday, I asked my coworker about his experience with the Blue Parrot, and he told me he has never been past the bar. Which is where we should have stopped. Thanks Luis.', ""Yes, I'm a fan! Who doesn't love spaghetti & meatballs, lasagne & garlic bread?For years, I've spied those Blue Parrot spaghetti sauce jars at Costco, but never tried it.

Up for a try, another couple joined us for a field trip to Louisville.Yes, the place could use an updating, it's fixed firmly in the 80's decor-wise. But then, ambiance is not why you go here. It's the homemade pasta, sauce & meats. Nothing fancy here, just good, basic, stick to the ribs Italian.Don't go for high end cuisine, but do go for a nice, inexpensive meal, especially if you are carb-loading :)"", 'I always look for the local classic, this place did not disappoint, a life long local sports hero gave me the recommendation . Thank you coach! Breakfast was served prompt, coffee hot. I had the two links and eggs with hash and toast. The links were made in the kitchen, just the right amount of spice. Our server and the owner were very hospitable and made us feel like regulars, we even got a Merry Christmas. We will be back for dinner , looking for some great Lasagna. Enjoy !']",negative
"[""They were busy but the layouts of the tables made it covid friendly. When you walk in there's a wall that blocks the door from most of the restaurant and there wasn't a host at the podium to seat us. So it was a little awkward standing there waiting for someone to come over. Once we were seated our waitress was very friendly. They have a wide selection of beers and fun cocktails. Their menu is also set up in theme with the restaurant so that was cute. Since it was our first time here we of course had to try the Mac and cheese which was delicious! We also tried the nachos, which were pretty good but nothing too special. We each got a chicken sandwich and both were delicious! The fries were also really good. We ate so much food and were stuffed. We will definitely be going back for the Mac and cheese!

I chose the Fourth Quarter sauce with the wings and it didn't have any flavor. The fries were horrible even though the menu description sounded amazing. The tacos were about average. Everything we ordered for food was $10-11 and honestly not worth it. The best thing we had was the $5 Land Grant on draft.

We didn't order drinks and it was happy hour. if I come back it will for drinks or just to meet friends. As always is this a place I would bring a friend from out of town. No. It was really nothing special. I forgot the chairs were metal and a bit on comfortable.

"[""We came here for a birthday lunch and we all had a great experience. The service was top notch along with the food. There were many entrees which were different. I couldn't decide so I asked the server for her favourite. I had the Parmesan Crusted Sole. I was impressed as the fish was cooked to perfection. The others were also impressed with the Seafood Chowder, Street Tacos, and Shrimp & Grits. If you're celebrating a special occasion, ask for a table near the window. You'll have a wonderful view of Columbia River. I mentioned to the server that we had a birthday celebration, and she brought us the Bread Pudding. It was delish.

Bonus is you can walk the waterfront once done with with your lunch or dinner.', 'I\'ve been coming here since the place opened and have loved it. Great quality food and generally good service. Tonight however was terrible on both accounts. I called for a Togo order, 2 burgers and another entree. The menu online lists a dinner burger I intended to order, apparently there is a separate to go menu not available online that has another burger. The person taking my order didn\'t ask which one I wanted, I have ordered the dinner burger to go before and never had a problem getting the one I wanted. They also didn\'t ask a temperature. I get the burgers home and they are the to go version, soggy, and raw in the middle. When I call back to make sure I wasn\'t charged for the more expensive burger I meant to get, I was informed of the other to go menu with another burger. The only explanation offered was, ""this is a good learning experience for our hostess staff"". Terrible quality food and terrible service when I called with a concern. The bolognese was delicious and up to their normal food standard so that\'s why they get 2 stars. I will not be ordering food to go without double checking everything including how much I\'m charged to make sure it is correct. Very disappointing.Update 3/1/22:After speaking with the management team they apologized and issued a gift card to cover the 2 burgers. As this is our only disappointing experience at this restaurant and usually they are fantastic, we will be returning. I have updated my star recommendation given their excellent customer service on follow up.', 'Great place for groups. We arrived here on Saturday and had Jamie as our server. The restaurant hostesses actually welcomed me in a few minutes earlier than their opening time. Jamie was so sweet and patient as my friends were running late. \xa0We had a booth. Initially the restaurant was pretty empty at opening and filled up considerably by the time we were done. I ordered the shrimp scampi and the French dip to share with my husband.

All well prepared and fresh.Service is attentive without being imposing. They have a very impressive selection of wines and they also have a full bar and a couple nice ciders too.My favorite menu item is the taco trio. They offer several proteins to fill your tacos, try getting a different meat for each one and discover which one you like best. My favorite is the wagyu beef but the cajun fish & jerk chicken are great choices as well.Garlic prawns, seafood fettuccine, peppercorn crusted steak and their mac & cheese are all on point too.

Superb service and amazing skill in connecting with their guests.Side note:Calamari was perfection My husband had the wedge salad with the petite sirloin- phenomenal I had the Wild Fin appetizer Tower. Calamari was perfect, with complimentary flavors, with the ahi tuna seared to ideal, and the shrimp with all its compatible flavors, just melted in my mouth.Cocktails were interesting and innovative. Great flavor combinations and definitely not lacking in alcohol (which I truly appreciate as we paid a high end cocktail price and 100% received it) Restaurant was clean, organized, and appeared flawlessly in sync. If it wasn't, we did not see it, which is what ever establishment strives toward. We recently relocated to Vancouver from Alaska (after 25 years).

Would be nice if they offered a half portion as well, especially for lunch. My mom couldn't finish hers and reheating fish and alfredo didn't sound appetizing. We asked the server and I guess they don't do anything for birthdays anymore. Last time we received a complimentary dessert with candle. This time we had to pay for dessert and no candle.

I changed my mind because I relied upon Yelp to make the decision to eat at the Tucker Longhorn's after my husband had been given a Longhorn's gift certificate. We haven't eaten in this restaurant for several years but I saw decent reviews and it is the close to my home. \xa0I prepared myself to be patient with the staff because I knew there were staff shortages and limited staff experience. We arrived around 5:45 and the restaurant was slightly busy. \xa0The hostess appeared to be training a new staff member. We were seated immediately in a section where several tables were occupied. \xa0Our server (J) arrived promptly to take our drink orders. \xa0My husband and I both ordered a long pour of wine as well as water. Both the drinks and the complimentary bread were served promptly. I believe because of his inexperience our server tried to pour my husband's wine first and he spilled a bit (a lot) on the table. Again, I believe, because of his inexperience, I had to request he wipe up the spill. \xa0I'm aging and my memory isn't what it used to me but I don't remember Longhorn's bread being stale and cold. \xa0In fact, the bread was one of the main reasons to eat that there. We placed our orders - Flo's fillet, Caesar Salad and baked sweet potato for hubby and salmon, chopped salad and brocolli for me. Because I requested no rice I was given a choice of a third side and I chose Brussel Sprouts. \xa0Salads were brought promptly. I made a mistake and didn't request dressing on the side. The lettuce was heavily coated with blue cheese dressing. \xa0We completed our salads and waited. \xa0Eventually our waiter brought our entrees. \xa0My husband's plate looked fine and J even waited for him to cut into the meat to make sure it was cooked correctly. I had requested my salmon be cooked medium and it was. \xa0Unfortunately the glaze on top of my fish was overcooked to the point of being burnt. \xa0My brocolli was overcooked but had a nice lemony flavor. \xa0The brussel sprouts were a no show. \xa0I had finished eating when J showed up with my sprouts. \xa0I tried one and wished they had arrived before I filled up on the other items - they were delicious. \xa0We had to wait after we completed eating for J to check on us to see if we needed anything else. \xa0We requested the check and a take home box and bag. \xa0The check and the box came promptly. \xa0I grabbed a bag on my way out the door. \xa0Longhorn's - I have patience with staff inexperience and with staff shortages. \xa0I don't have patience with poorly cooked food."", ""I've begin to think I'm dead but I'm the only person who doesn't know it.

It was a lot of shrimp, so when my husband ate his salad, \xa0he added some shrimp on top. Next, for our entree I ordered the Redrock grilled shrimp. I don't like rice, so I had mashed potatoes and broccoli. It comes with 8 or 12 shrimp, so I had 8. My husband is a meat eater and loves steak, so he had the Longhorn porterhouse steak. It's 22 ounces of a perfect steak. He had a loaded baked potato with his dinner. I didn't eat all of my food, as usual and my husband didn't either. So we packed everything up and my husband has leftovers since I don't eat leftover food. :-) Our son didn't dine with us, but we ordered his food to go. He had an 8 ounce renegade sirloin steak, well done. I also ordered a strawberries and cream shortcake. I ate a some and gave the rest to my son.

You never know what people may do to your food.', 'Grub Burger has a really vegan plant based burger. \xa0I was not expecting me to like it as much as I did that I ate it more than once in a two week period time frame.The plant based burger is called Maverick at Grub Burger. It has Beyond meat with roasted garlic aioli, tomato, spinach, Swiss and French fried onions. I got onion rings on the side.The second time I ordered it, I added lettuce, mustard, jalapenos on it too. No extra charge!42/2021', 'This place used to be amazing, five stars, great experience and tasty, unique food. Over the last couple of years, it has continually deteriorated in quality and we\'ve just said ""well, times are hard"". But after today\'s visit, I honestly would now rather just go to Five Guys or Culver\'s. Things that have changed from five-star-Grub to now:- they used to hand out buzzers and stopped that in favor of table numbers. You have to pick out an empty table from across the restaurant while standing at the register, so they can record the number when you place your order. This was fine in the just-reopened-after-Covid days when they weren\'t very busy. Now they often have a line, so people poach tables. When you try to correct your table number with the staff, all seems fine - but then they bring your order out to the poachers anyway. Hope you\'re sitting nearby and can hear this happening so you can snag your food!- items have been dropped from the menu due to ingredient cost - most notably, the Texas Luau burger with its pineapple and pulled pork.- food quality has dropped overall. They used to sell their day-old buns by the bag and donate the funds to charity; now they just serve them to customers. Or else they\'ve changed their bun recipe so that they\'re dry, stale, and crumbly even on the day they\'re baked. \xa0They\'ve also switched their fries from the original shoestring seasoned fries to Ore-Ida-style crinkle fries.- they are way understaffed for their level of traffic. The ladies at the table next to us sat down when the table was still dirty, because no clean tables were open. They ordered both milkshakes and food. A staff member delivered the milkshakes and started to walk away. The ladies asked her if she could please take the dirty dishes with her. She gave an excuse of ""sorry, we\'re trying, it\'s really busy""...and then *still* walked away leaving the dirty dishes on their table! Finally another nearby table left, someone came to get *those* dishes, and the ladies were able to get that staff member to also clean their table.I will miss the way Grub used to be, and their different unique burgers. But I\'d rather go to a place that only does basic burgers (Culver\'s/FG/etc) and easily get a fresh, quality burger, than have to fight for a table to eat a dry Guacapotle with Ore-Ida fries. It will be a long time before I go back to give them another shot.', ""Yesterday I went to grub burger to pick up a To- go order. I'm going o give them grace in this review but it wasn't the best experience. I've Eaten here before snd those times were great, but yesterday wasn't my best experience with Grub Burger. I placed my order online and it was suppose to be ready in 15 minutes of course things happen and it's not the case. When I went to pick up my order at the arrival time I was given. I ended up waiting an additional 30 mins to get my food. They seemed to have been very busy the inside of the restaurant was packed and the line at the counter wasn't long but orders were taken longer than usual to be taken. When I finally got my food items were missing and the fries were cold. It was pretty disappointing, but as I mentioned I'd gone twice before and there were no problems. I'll give a three because I like this place and understand sometimes there are off days."", ""While out running errands I was craving a burger so I decided to order from Grub Burger as they were 5 minutes from my location. I ordered for pickup and they brought my order to my car when I arrived.Voodoo mushroom burger with the beyond meat patty, Absinthe sauteed mushrooms, Swiss cheese & on a wheat bun. I added lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, mustard and ketchup. I also got the split decision sweet potato fries and onion rings. The burger was delicious the fries were ok.The best part is they have a variety of dipping sauces for free. I got the jalapeño ranch, chipotle ketchup, Mississippi comeback sauce, and honey mustard. If I'm in a burger mood I could eat here again as it's in my neighborhood."", 'First time at grub burger. After a long hot day floating on the Chattahoochee I came over to grub burger to grab a quick bite to eat. I had the turkey burger which was kind of dry.

The burger was overcooked, it had 1 slice of tomato and 3 pickles. The sauce was lightly brushed on the bun making it almost non-existent and dry. They threw 1 ketchup and 2 mustards in the bag. What I can't understand is why it was called the bacon lovers burger ?? It didn't even have 1 whole slice of bacon on the burger, it had more cheese and lettuce than anything else I did eat a section of the burger by itself, and it was a good patty and seasoned nicely and still moist even after being overcooked. The Meal as a whole completely missed the mark especially When you add in the 20% tip, for a meal total of 18.50 for 1 burger fries and a drink NOT WORTH it, \xa0I did see a lot of really good reviews, which is why I decided to try this place out""]",positive

There was plenty of indoor seating."", ""This is the poutine we expect from Canada. They have many classic poutines as well as unique ones. We ordered the smoked meat poutine and it was delicious.

I wish we had more access to Poutine in the States. While it wasn't as good as the Poutine I had back in Toronto, it was still fresh and flavorful! The cheese curds (as noted in the pictures) were PLENTIFUL! That alone got this review 4 stars ;)The portions were plentiful as well, so I am glad I went when I was hungry. I appreciated the fast service. It was a cold day when I visited, so it was amazing to bite into the crispy, piping hot fries. The cheese curds provided the best balance for the temperature heat of the fries. The gravy may have been a bit much...One thing I surely appreciated was the fact that nothing was over-salted.

For some reason, maybe the name, I didn't really have high expectations about Pokey Okey and thought it as possibly subpar poke.There was a promotion on FanTuan for $10 off $20 on delivery orders and decided to give it a try. (It was too good a deal to pass up)It was prepared very quickly and the quality of the poke was excellent. They have spicy ahi (rather than regular tuna as most other poke restaurants with an upcharge for ahi) and the tuna was bright, fresh, and flavourful. It was definitely fresh. The spicy salmon is your typical Atlantic farmed salmon with spicy sauce. Not necessary fantastic but it is also once again fresh. The spicy sauce was great and the salmon was well seasoned. The toppings, sauces, and brown rice along with salad was excellent as well. Overall everything about the poke was great and it was definitely one of the better poke I've had. The price is also rather reasonable (even without the promotion - but with the promotion, it's an incredible deal). I didn't get to experience the service as I had delivery than takeout or dine in. However, it seemed to be prepared quickly and with care. The delivery was also friendly and great. So overall it was a very positive experience!Surely one of the better or best poke in Richmond. (Which was unexpected, with the promotion - I was expecting subpar quality but it surprised me.)"", 'First time visiting Pokey Okey because of Yelp launching the support local ""buy one get what"" event!!!I tried the Red Bowl!

There's no dine in service right now so this was probably my most expensive meal in the car, but it was a nice change being able to enjoy the bowl while listening to the sound of heavy rain.Totally thought it was an egg yolk in the middle but I quickly realized it was more uni goodness! I thought it was really interesting how the bowl was paired with black rice, but I'm glad because that way the bowl was more filling. The rest of the bowl was filled with Grade A BC local uni, caviar, Hokkaido scallops, and salmon roe. I enjoyed the bowl and hope to be back soon to try their regular poke!"", ""Poke shops have been the newest trend in Vancouver. They're starting to pop up all over the place and I'm loving it!

Pokey Okey has another location in Richmond as well.The store front isn't very large. Once you walk in you're greeted by the prep stations. The way they set it up for the event was each bowl had a different station. All the ingredients here are fresh and you could tell that they really focus on presentation despite being so busy because every bowl they put out looked perfect! They do good portion control here using electronic scales to measure the proteins and ice cream scoops to measure toppings. I like this because it ensures that every bowl is the same.The yellow bowl: This bowl was the sweetest of the 3 signature bowls because it had sweet egg omelette, pineapple salsa and corn. The proteins for this was salmon and scallop. I liked that it also had wakame seaweed and pickled onions to add another element of flavour. If you're a fan of sweet and savory flavours, this it he perfect choice for you. I'm not sure if it was because they had to prep a lot of rice but the rice was a bit softer than I'm used."", ""There aren't many poke shops in Richmond so I'm glad Pokey Okey is around for when the poke cravings hit! Unlike some other poke shops, they actually have 3 bowl sizes. I opted for the small which comes with 1 scoop of protein ($11) and I built my own bowl. I also ordered online through their website for pick up. Everything was fresh and delicious!

Well, Richmond.Parking here is quite awful before 2100. Try the Minoru park complex where the library, or the near mall parking. Just don't get caught.Staff were friendly and helpful.The bowls can be either preset, or customized. According to the guy behind the counter, the most popular bowls are the yellow and red bowls, in that order. The place was so good I ended up trying both just days apart.The yellow bowl is of a sweeter variety, thanks to the pineapple and tamago (sweet egg) bits. Tasty, but personally I wish there was a bit more kick to it. The seafood is salmon and scallop.The red bowl is of the spicy variety, and is my preferred choice compared to yellow. The spicy kick comes from kimchi, and this bowl also has a lot more of the seafood bits I've come to associate with poke. Nice generous portions of flying fish roe, and tuna and salmon. As an added bonus, this bowl includes bacon bits.What makes this place special is the large portions. This place must have the largest poke bowls in town. I've been leery with poke around here because I often had to end up grabbing a burger after going hungry. The large bowl here was satisfying. So satisfying in fact that it ruined my buddy's and my dinner plans a few hours later. I was dreaming of poke that night.Recommended with great reverence."", ""Great poke place in Richmond, with a convenient website for ordering takeout ahead of time. Although a little pricey as all poke places tend to be, their fish and add ons are fresh and make it worth it! The reason I knocked one star off is because they put the ramen egg in the wrong bowl (ordered 1 small 1 regular) and gave me other toppings I didn't ask for.Still, I'll be back for more!""]",positive
"['Was referred over by two different locals (hotel desk and Uber driver) it did not disappoint.

Never met one person who regretting going there. When I take friends from out of town here, that's the first place we go when they come back. 10/10 would go there again."", 'My Terry Blacks Sausage HaikuSmoky mouthfeel meatThe underdog of proteinsTerry blacks longshot', ""I realize I'll probably get bashed for giving an Austin institution 3 stars on Yelp but that's just how the dice lands when I compare what Terry Black's has to offer to all of the other BBQ in Houston, Austin, Lockhart, and Lexington (which has my favorite of all time) and what I hope is an objective assessment.The spaceParking is a little tight, but manageable, there's a decent inflow/outflow of people. There was still a line out the door around 1pm on a Monday, and a little less so when we left, but it moves at a decent pace. There are plenty of seats (way more than the parking) so you'll definitely be able to find the right spot for your party, whether it's indoors or outdoors.The foodNow the meat is going to be 90% of the review for a BBQ joint. You can read someone else's review on how the sides are. Overall, the brisket and prime we ordered were fairly juicy, seasoned, and that bbq beefiness you expect. Where I think the BBQ falls short are 1) the temperature of the meats were just barely warm, the meat sits on the counter because someone makes sure there's always meat ready to be sliced up, and the temp gets compromised, 2) the meat is over-seasoned, like a heavy-handed use of salt, which made me want to eat each piece with bread just to balance out the seasoning, 3) the prime rib was probably the most disappointing cut. Yes it had a tenderness to it that make it easy to take off the bone, but the amount of fat and bone relative to muscle/lean meat was pretty dismal: I'd estimate 40% bone, 30% fat, 25% meat, 5% connective tissue by volume. In retrospect, I should've taken a harder look at the beef rib during checkout and pushed back on them. The jalapeño sausage was pretty on point though!The verdictI will say that Terry Black's has a great operation set up, they can certainly dish out meats (with all meats available) well into lunch time, which many other BBQ joints can't claim. At least based on my observations, it seems like in the effort to service the number of people they can and at a respectable speed, a few corners were cut, namely the temperatures, proper seasoning, and portioning/distribution of fat.I give Terry Black's 3 alright's, out of 5."", ""Terry Blacks is the quintessential Texas barbecue joint. Dingy interior lighting, neon signs, and local icy brews for the line - meeting all the key requirements. The line is outside the building, but it moves quickly - about 20 minutes on this visit. Come here for the beef ribs.Beef Ribs: You won't be gnawing the meat off the dinosaur-sized bone because it has already fallen off from gentle jostling. The meat has been smoked to perfection. There's a solid red smoke ring. The black peppery crust is flavorful. The meat is soft and tender with an ideal amount of chewiness. The flavor is beefy and marbled. The onions and pickles balance the richness. The beef ribs are the best thing here. Brisket: The brisket slices are a little on the dry side. Ordering: You start by ordering the sides. Don't forget to ask for free pickles, onions, and bread. Then you select what meat you want: brisket, beef ribs ribs, turkey, pork ribs, chopped beef, or sausage.

The second time we went was on a weekday at 11am and there was no line. We tried every meat besides the giant beef rib. From talking to other tables around us, they did not think it was worth $80. The pork ribs were really tasty. They were like eating candy. One or two was plenty. The jalapeño cheddar sausage was one of the better links I have had. The turkey was surprisingly very moist. The brisket was moist and flavorful, both the fatty and the lean. Except when they were not busy and the brisket sat out a little longer than during a rush, the lean brisket was dry. The creamed corn is definitely one of the best out there. I think it is a must try if you eat here. The mac and cheese is sadly skippable. If you are a coleslaw person you will like it here. The corn bread was awful. The Banana Pudding is also a must try. I think about it often. Overall, this place is a must try. One piece of advise- it is very easy to go overboard on the meats.

I have a feeling there\'s better bbq in Austin. We got a large takeout order so that may have been a part of it, but wasn\'t too impressed. The brisket was okay, but it wasn\'t very moist or ""fall off the bone"", just a bit tough. For sides: the creamed corn was good but more of a corn in milk. It was very running. The Mac and cheese was definitely the highlight! It was rich, and tasted great. The cornbread was a close second, good flavor. Not too sweet', ""In my frequent trips to ATX, BBQ is always a must and locals will point you to different places for the best. Franklin's, Salt Lick, La Barbeque and Terry Black's Barbecue. Going for lunch around 12:15 p.m. on a Tuesday, here's my experience:1) Food: Out of all the BBQ spots I've visited in Austin, Terry's offers a wide range of sides and meats. Where they differ is the limited selection of meats. They have brisket (of course) and sausage, but no pulled pork. I ordered the cream corn (too sweet for my liking), mac and cheese (very good), banana pudding (so amazing!) and a brisket sandwich (the meat was hit or miss with the fat). BBQ sauce- OG, spicy and sweet- is on every table and picnic table. 2) Drinks: They have fountain drinks and tons of different can drinks, including a blackberry hard cider that I found refreshing.3) Experience: Most BBQ spots have lines in ATX, including Terry Black's BBQ. What's different is the process. Despite a line, it moves fast! You start with ordered sides, desserts and toppings. The server gives you a tray that you bring to one of several cashiers. As they ring you up, a person adds the meat you want to your tray. Signs are everywhere walking you through the experience and menu. 4) Space: It's HUGE! There's a massive dining room with several sections, decorated in art. The outside patio is equally massive. 5) Location: It's south of downtown and within walking distance to many other great restaurants and Zilker Park, a large city park with sand volleyball courts, trails and city views.""]",positive

Some faves include the tree top fried rice, curries (they're all delicious), lemon grass chicken, capricorn shrimp, tom yum soup, and summer rolls. Their pad thai and drunken noodles are awesome too. I could keep going, but I'll leave it there for now.The people who work here are joyful and kind -- the kind of people who make supporting a local restaurant feel even more rewarding. I always appreciate the artful doodles they leave on the takeout bags. Regarding COVID safety measures, they have a great system and it is easy to see that they are taking all precautions.Tree Top --\xa0I love you! Never change."", 'This a hidden gem the food is first rate staff are nice fast clean friendly and very Corvid conscious', ""I've ordered Tree Top Thai a couple times and I always get Crazy Noodles and Mango Sticky Rice. Their Pad Thai is alright but nothing my favorite. The satay portion is pretty generous and great to share. My friend enjoyed the Tofu and Penang Vegetable Curry. The Tree Top Fried rice is really hearty, there's lots of different vegetables but it is a bit on the oily side. In general I like Tree Top Thai over many of the other Thai places in general and the Mango Sticky Rice never misses."", ""Love this mom and pop Thai restaurant \xa0and how they put so much care in their food and packaging! Their country style pad Thai is the best I've ever had! Everything is very flavorful!"", 'Their food is fantastic, but their logistics are disappointing. I ordered dinner at 6:37, it was supposed be ready at 6:57. I arrived at 7:15 worrying my food might be sitting and cold, but instead stood around waiting until 7:47, over an hour after placing the order, almost an hour after the food was SUPPOSED to be ready.', ""Tree Top has grown into one of my favorite restaurants ever!! I typically get the Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp or their Green Curry with fried tofu, but everything is delicious. Their Crab Rangoon are also a great treat if you want something extra comforting in your tummy. On top of all that, they've done a great job when it comes to Covid safety. Everyone I've seen wears their masks properly and they have a designated area right inside the door for picking up takeout so you're in and out quickly. Someone there also personalizes each takeout bag with a cute drawing, which is such a nice touch! If you want great Thai food at an affordable price, that'll be ready quickly from a restaurant that takes safety seriously, this is the place to go!""]",positive
"[""This is one of my favorite breakfast places in Natick. First of all, the menu is 10/10, they have so many options and so much authentic and yummy high quality food. The latkes are amazing, the eggs benedicts, omelettes, avocado toast, all so good. They also have the BEST FRIES!!! I am so picky about my fries and I love these, they have such good seasoning and are crispy. To top it off they have a lot of lunch options as well.If you're a pickle fan you will definitely want to get one if their HUGE in house made dill pickles."", ""Great place for brunch. But Its crowded on weekends. So plan accordingly. They have friendly staff. They serve amazing coffee. I really like their Mediterranean omelet. It has spinach olives and feta cheese. It's delicious.

I was a little skeptical when I saw only 3.5 stars on Yelp... but what are these people thinking. This is a 4+ star deli.

Very delicious and totally worth the stop.', ""Because the Brookline location has been temporarily closed, my husband and I wanted to come out to Nadick to get our cravings satisfied at Zaftigs! Not surprisingly, there was a wait but it went by quickly since there's lots of stores nearby to explore to pass time. It's also quite easy to find parking here. Once seated, the service was quick and straight forward. We ordered the zaftigs combo, the empire eggs Benedict that has the potato pancakes (our FAV), and the granola pancakes. The combo showcases their popular cheese blintz, potato pancake, potato knish, and sweet noodle Kugel. Personally, I LOVED the sweet noodle kugel and my husband thoroughly enjoyed the potato knish. The potato pancake is also a favorite which is why I love the empire eggs Benedict as I think the potato pancake in it adds a more unique overall crunchy texture and taste than a normal benny with an English muffin or such. \xa0The granola pancake was also super filling. We appreciated that it wasn't overly sweet and we loved the flavorful date butter. Overall, Zaftigs never disappoints with the food options they provide. We also had their blueberry muffin at the front counter and that's a very delicious option to go if you're looking for something quick. Can't wait for the Brookline location to reopen, but meanwhile, happy and excited to come back here again!"", 'Not sure why some low reviews but i have nothing but 5 star feelings about the place.

"[""On a Sunday afternoon I decided to go on a brewery tour and definitely not to justify day drinking. Tours happen every hour on the half hour mark, so I paid $10 for my ticket and waited for the tour to start.The tour, which lasted an hour, explained the basic process of beer brewing, highlighted some specific equipment (e.g. an automated keg filler), explained the brewery's history, and ended with a tasting at a private tap room, with a dozen options available to taste. After the tour ended, I went to the beer hall and ordered some more beers (~$7-9ea). From the Boston Irish Stout (think Guinness but locally made and slightly drier) to the Hometown Hat Trick (a dry hopped pilsner), everything seemed solid.I also ordered a pretzel ($6.5) for snacking. The dough seemed extra springy; the tour mentioned that spent mash from the brewing process goes into the pretzel dough to give that extra chewiness. The ale mustard tasted like Dijon mustard, but slightly less viscous and slightly less sharp. It can still go into the nose on a large dollop. The IPA cheese possessed an interesting consistency, almost like a puree. Otherwise, the cheese seemed like a mild white cheese, and the flavor of alcohol would pop up occasionally. Overall, these details make Harpoon's pretzel stand out.From tour to tasting to pretzel, everything seemed enjoyable and reasonably priced. The tour price seemed almost criminally low. Having nothing seem off or being nitpick-able cements this as a place to which to return."", ""Awesome brewery. So many flavors - service is quick and staff is friendly. The tour was wonderful. I highly recommended you take it if you're ever in the area. Book it in advance online. You sample a ton of flavors and the guide was super knowledgeable on the beers. It was awesome seeing all the old cans on the wall too."", 'Harpoon Brewery & Beer Hall is a craft brewery and beer hall that opened in Boston, Massachusetts in 1986. It was founded by friends Dan Kenary, Rich Doyle and George Ligeti. The three friends all met in college and soon learned that they were all passionate about beer. They were constantly disappointed in the fact that they couldn\'t find beers to their liking in local bars. They traveled to Europe after college and were immediately impressed with the diverse brewing scene there. In an effort to bring that kind of culture to Boston, they came up with the name \'Harpoon Brewery\' and received the first brewing permit for the state of Massachusetts. They obtained a building, brewing equipment, and hired Russ Heissner \xa0as the brewmaster. The original \'Harpoon Ale\' finally debuted to local bars in June 1987.In 1993, they released \'Harpoon IPA\'. This beer has since become their flagship beer and helped to make Harpoon the brewery that it is today. In 2000, the company purchased the former Catamount Brewery in Windsor, Vermont. This enabled the company to brew and distribute on a much larger scale, as they had reached full capacity at the Boston facility. In 2013, Harpoon opened their 6,000-square-foot Beer Hall and Visitor\'s Center on the second floor of their Boston facility. This gave customers a modern brewery tasting room experience. My wife and I first visited Harpoon Brewery & Beer Hall in April 2018. The Beer Hall was a really nice space overlooking Boston\'s Seaport District. We wanted to take a tour of the brewing facility, but by the time we arrived all tours had already been booked for the rest of the day. Instead we decided to order some taster flights. We ordered and shared the \'Harpoon Flight\' and the \'IPA Flight\'. Our favorite offering was ""Juicer"": a hazy New England IPA. We purchased a pack of cans to take home. Harpoon also make delicious pretzels in their kitchen with leftover brewing yeast. We ordered a parmesan pretzel with marinara dipping sauce. It was delicious and paired well with our flights. We had fun at Harpoon Brewery and hope to one day visit their Vermont facility!', 'Made a last minute decision to join a $5 brewery tour on a Thursday afternoon. Andrew spent 15 minutes educating us on the beers, and 15 minutes letting us try whatever we wanted! The tour was totally worth it! Stayed after to enjoy a soft pretzel and an additional beer. Also took a crowler home with us for only $5.50. Will definitely return!', ""Among the best of the beer in Boston. Harpoon is a local brewery that also is pretty popular across the country. It has a brewpub with some food like pizza and pretzels. Get a sampling of what they have to offer at pretty decent prices for around here. Tours are available and these include tastings. I checked this out with the girl to have some beer and food. It was busy in the early evening and we had to squeeze in to get a seat at the bar, which we were able to get. The bar is in the middle of the brewery, which is like an old big warehouse. It most likely was a long time ago. The tour is worth going to at least once. As for the beer, it's the main thing of course. Lots of fun sounding styles. I had a Big League. It's $7 for a pint. This is a lager that's real smooth. In addition we had a Famous Salted Pretzel. It's $6.50 and this is a pretty interesting looking one as far as pretzels. This is real fluffy unlike most of these. It's not a twisted one but rather it's a knot. This comes with a choice of dipping sauce. A good one is the ale mustard. The other popular food item seems to be pizza. Check it out for beer and food. It has tours which are kind of fun. The prices aren't bad for any of these."", ""Was visiting Boston and was so glad to finally check out Harpoon Brewery! The vibe was lively and perfect for friends gatherings. The employees were also super friendly and helpful. When we were about to sit down, there was a lot of water on the seat but one of the employees took care of \xa0it promptly which we greatly appreciate. We got one of the UFO flight and the pretzel. The pretzel was honestly so good and I really like how there's so many sauce options to choose from. You can't go wrong with this item! Will definitely visit again next time to make sure that we go on the tour!"", ""When friends heard we were going to Boston they said you need to go to Harpoon Brewery. So we did. One hiccup was we took a 20 minute Lyft ride to get to Harpoon at 12:30 as it should have been open. When we tried to enter we were dismayed to find a sign that said it wasn't opening until 1:00 PM that day. There was a poor chap with two suitcases and a big backpack looking forlorn and waiting for it to open. \xa0The brewery is in an industrial area so it wasn't like he could sit in the coffee shop next door to wait. Suitcaseless we walked a few blocks to Yankee Lobster Co to wait. So you might want to call ahead to make sure they are open.I had a sampler of Harpoon beer and all of the beer was great. They also have Clown Shoes and other brands on tap. We heard the pretzel was great and it was. It's unlike other pretzels I have had being thick and doughy, but it was delicious. We had the beer cheese and garlic butter dipping sauces, which really complemented it. If you have to choose between visiting Sam Adams and Harpoon, chose Harpoon."", 'Harpoon ended up being one of our favorite places during our east coast trip, especially for the blueberry beer. We came here and decided to do the 30 minute tour- it was only $5 per person & was basically a sample as much beer as you want while the guide talked. It was interesting to learn about the different brands associated with Harpoon & some of their history. My other favorite beer was their stout- it was on nitro so tasted extra creamy but not too heavy. After the tour, we each got a beer and tried their pretzel. The pretzel was ok but I really enjoyed the garlic Parmesan dipping sauce. There are some other food options available too. We sat inside but there is a pretty cool outdoor space that has games and beer/food available as well. I wish we could get the Maine blueberry beer back in Indiana- I will definitely purchase that again if I can ever find it.', 'Came to Boston and was really excited about the brewery and bar scene. Staff was friendly, the place had a lot of energy, and there were lots of beer options to choose from. Not to mention, everything was super well priced! I had the Harpoon flight and liked each one, especially with the great variety. I highly recommend stopping by for their trivia evenings, it was a lot of fun!', ""Harpoon has one of the best soft pretzels I've had. I'd recommend getting the salted and the dessert pretzel, neither will disappoint. They have a guided tour of the facility which ends in a tasting room where they will give you as much to drink as you can handle. The staff is fun and upbeat and they'll remember your name after hearing it once. Cannot recommend enough!""]",positive

Great customer service too.', ""They are only offering carry out now and it's difficult to find their menu but I managed to see it on their Facebook page, updated in 2018.Pad Thai has always been my to go dish at Thai restaurant but I was debating if I should order it after reading some reviews. And I did. Everyone has different taste and their pad Thai is indeed different from other Thai's restaurant(lacking the spice). However, they did mention it was in tamarind sauce on their menu, so it is on the sweet-sour side. It may not be my favorite but it's still tasty. I only managed to eat half in one go as it can be a little overwhelming. The peanuts and lime is served on the side. To complement the meal, I got the Thai iced tea. I think they used condensed milk so it's quite sweet too. It would have been a nice complement if the pad thai is not that sweet.FYI: there's a bell somewhere on the table so ring it for service.

Then when he took my order, he asked me what I wanted to drink. I stated water. He still didn't bring me water after taking my order even though he was standing there doing mostly nothing as it wasn't busy and there was only one other person sitting at the bar. I finally had to ask for water again. I also asked him to recommend vegan options on the menu. He recommended the green machine sushi roll and the little island sushi roll. Another staff member, that just happened to be standing there, spoke up and said the green machine sushi roll isn't actually vegan but I could substitute something in it to make it vegan. She was extremely helpful but she also had what I would call a typical hipster mean girl attitude. There wasn't any soy sauce on the bar. I had to ask for soy sauce when my food came. A sushi restaurant should have soy sauce at every table and on the bar (where people eat). I have eaten here a few times now. The first time (about 4 years ago) was incredible in every way. It just went downhill after that. The last time before this, the waiter suggested something that had honey it after I told him I was looking for vegan options. This last time was even worse and will probably be the last time I eat here. Too bad because the food is actually really tasty. One last thing is I don't think it's appropriate to have people working with customers that do not look professional. Most of the folks working at Bamboo do not look professional."", ""When searching for somewhere open and available for dine-in on NYE, Bamboo Sushi was the first place that answered my call! Even though their website showed no more openings for reservations that night, the host was able to get my friend and I a seat for later in the evening. She was super accommodating and truly awesome for being able to find us a table!I had dined at Bamboo only once before, probably 4 years ago and didn't think it was that life-changing, which is why it wasn't somewhere I was dying to go back to or frequent. Fast forward to now however, and I thought pretty much everything we had, was solid. The quality of the fish was good, and portion sizes were definitely bigger than I expected, making the price of everything a pretty good deal in my opinion.Here's what we got:-Edamame: always a great appetizer; they also give it to you in a larger portion than expected.-Salmon Skin Salad: skip this. The salmon skin was too chewy and pieces were a bit skinny. The dressing wasn't my fave either.-Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice: the truffle eel sauce is awesome and the ratio between the tuna and crispy rice was great. Eat it while it's hot!-Green Machine roll with Salmon: I heard great things about this roll, and can't hype it up enough. It has a great flavor from the cilantro sweet chili aioli, and the lightest crunch from the tempura fried green bean. I think the salmon added a great touch to an otherwise veggie forward roll.-Rainbow Bowl: worth it! $13 is a steal for how large the bowl is. It's perfect for sharing. the only thing I would say on this, is that the rice at the bottom of the bowl was soaked in sauce, so we ended up not finishing because of how drenched and salty the rice was - not a huge deal though especially if you like your stuff saucy!!Overall, I was impressed with my second go-around with Bamboo, and will definitely be back :)"", ""Really exceptional food, drink and atmosphere here. Loved the cocktails we ordered and we stuck to miso soup for appetizers and chef's assortment of sashimi. We will definitely be back soon. If the management read this, please put a seaweed salad on the menu! We'll be back soon."", ""The fish is fresh and high quality, something that is expected by now at Bamboo sushi. The omakase is great, if a little basic, but enjoyable nonetheless. The real issue holding this location back is the poor seating set up and very dimly lit environment. I get the ambiance that they're going for, but I want to be able to see how beautiful the fish looks. In addition, we were sat near the host's podium and during our entire meal we listened to the staff socialize. Overall, food was good, service was quick, and even though I could name a handful of other establishments that do sushi better, I get why this is such a popular restaurant."", ""If you live in Portland ,you already know Bamboo is pretty popular and even though in my humble opinion there are a few other places that do Sushi better than them , they still would be in my top 5 for the ambience ,good service and of course Sushi . I had not been to this location before as there are two other locations that are much closer to where we live but we decided to give them a try . I would say this is a nicer spot than the other two but that's just my personal opinion . The service was pretty good from the start and our food arrived quickly . we went with the tried and tested and ordered items we knew they do well . The cocktails were a pleasant surprise as they turned out really good too \xa0. Overall , a good spot for a nice dinner ."", 'Great food, great ambience, and good service most of the time. It would be nice if they were more friendly when they seated you though...', ""Went for my son's birthday this past weekend. \xa0We had a lovely covid socially distanced table and our server was delightful!

I've noticed their Bamboo Burger on the menu many times and wondered fifteen bucks for a burger? It's probably for kids that don't like sushi. Last year during the pandemic my curiosity got me, why not try one.So we tried both! No one does Shishito peppers like Bamboo so the Teriyaki Shishito Burger was a must try also! Both were Delicious!That memory had been hanging around for about a year when we decided to go back for more. This time it was five Bamboo Burgers and an order of Shishito Peppers to go, along with an Avocado Roll just for fun.Wow! Just as good as last time! Thick, juicy, perfectly seasoned, and beautiful to look at! The tempura onion ring is a standalone gourmet treat! I have never had an onion ring so wonderfully cooked and seasoned!

"['I dig the decor - an Ouija board on one wall, headless and limbless mannequin on another, and hands tied to long strings of varying length hang above the bar. Came here for brunch with some friends. I highly recommend the Cuke Perry Bloody Mary - uses cucumber gin and has the right amount of spices and tomato juice. I had the Boomtown Burger and my other friends ordered the Chicken and Pancakes and scotch egg. It was the perfect brunch burger -a layer of fried egg, ham, arugula, cheese, and a hashbrown made for some hefty eating, but I loved it! It wasn\'t too greasy, meat was cooked tenderly, and I still managed to have some of each layer in each bite, which is hard to do with all those ingredients. Fries were more average than I was expecting - I don\'t even think they were seasoned. My friend really liked his chicken and pancakes. It was a huge portion of fried chicken and pancakes! I\'ve never had scotch eggs, but my other friend who got it is a fan, and said theirs was really good. Overall, The Gallows is more of a hearty place for brunch, not somewhere to ""eat light."" If you\'re up for it, though, definitely worth a stop.', ""This is such an ecclectic space - there's ravens and an edger allan poe poem on the wall, hand lights over the bar, and a huge ouijie board on the wall. The music is very nostalgic for the millenials too! It was a great experience. The service is excellent and the brunch was great too!The fried chicken with the chicken and pancakes was sooo good - the pancakes were kind of dry ane not amazing but still good. The flavored butter on top really tied everything together. The poutine with the egg was interesting \xa0and the fries were yum but I wish it was real cheese curds like I'm used to in Canada. I had never tried a scotch egg before so that was cool - wish there was more pork as it was good. Can't wait to come back for dinner!"", ""Nothing special. \xa0Average food served in a very noisy room. \xa0Not bad, just kind of boring. \xa0Maybe something imaginative will open in its place, now that it's gone."", ""I would give five stars for the interior and decorations. I loved all of it, especially the giant ouija board on the wall. Not sure how keen I was to have Mike Tyson's mug shot staring down at me as I used the restroom but I liked the idea. I got a very other worldly, haunted vibe from the building. I bet there's a lot of history there.Our waitress was very nice too. Explained the menu and always came to check on us even though it seemed like she was serving all of the tables.The drink menu is unique. They were out of the passion fruit beer that my dining companion wanted but he was pretty pleased with the Farm Ale that replaced it. I tried a cocktail called Elder Wand and featured elder flower liquor but really didn't like it. Tasted like medicine.For food, I went with the Our Way Burger. Cooked nicely and I enjoyed the toppings, especially the pickles. I didn't like the cheese fries. In fact, we didn't like his side of poutine fries either (more on that in a minute). The cheese was overcooked and just a hard blob in the middle of the fries which also tasted way overcooked and not fresh at all. We first ordered the Scottish Egg and really liked that. Very unique item. Small for the price though but very tasty! My partner got the Falafel Burger. No complaints on the burger, very nice. The poutine as a side, however, shouldn't be called poutine. The key to poutine is to use cheese curds. This had feta chunks. Yes, feta. That's not poutine. The gravy was also wrong and not the traditional brown gravy that should go with poutine but a very thick, creamy gravy that had virtually no taste. I'd go with a 4 if rating the burgers but both fries were no good. Overcooked in both dishes and the poutine was 100% wrong. This restaurant comes up a lot when you search for poutine in the Boston area and I would hate someone to go expecting traditional poutine and get what we were served with feta (again, wth?) and the wrong gravy.I'd go back as I really loved the building and the burger was good but I'd stay away from ordering fries in any form with my meal."", ""Came here for a pre-movie dinner with some girlfriends and it was good. It's a fun place, they decorated the wall like a giant ouija board. We tried the fried babybels and they were so good, I could have eaten the whole plate. I had a burger with truffle fries and that was good as well. They give a generous portion of fries!I was impressed with the cocktail menu and enjoyed both my drinks. I will say that we visited in the middle of a terrible heat wave, and it was a bit warm inside."", 'Very cool place for some \xa0comfort food. I absolutely love the decor. I sat underneath a mural \xa0Ouiji board. \xa0I had the burger and subsituted the regular fries with \xa0Poutine fries which is a great idea considering the regular order is \xa0ridonkulous!!!

Great for the Southend area.', ""Such a fun place for brunch... the decor is very on brand (the wall behind the mannequin has the entire text of The Raven) and the cocktails have cute names. We got poutine, breakfast tacos, and the breakfast sandwich... all tasty. The hash browns were yummy also. I wouldn't say this is a must do, but if you're in the neighborhood and are in the mood for ambiance and snacks, drop in!"", 'This spot is way less morbid than its name would suggest. It\'s well-lit, friendly, and warm... though there is a gigantic Ouija board and an armless and legless bust as decoration.We came for Saturday brunch, during which we enjoyed the half serving of simple poutine, French toast, and chicken and pancakes. The poutine overall was great, though the ""cheese curds"" were definitely not curd-like. The flavors were delicious though so I\'m not too fazed. I did not partake in the French toast though it looked exquisite. The chicken and pancakes were great - I thought the chicken could have been a bit more seasoned underneath, but the pepper butter was INCREDIBLE and the pancakes were so goddamn soft. The waitstaff were so friendly, too! Definitely a winner for brunch.', ""The Gallows has the best burger I've had in Boston so far. And this is coming from someone who loves her burgs! I came in last night with friends for dinner. We didn't get cocktails so I can't speak to \xa0those, but we did get fried pickles as an appetizer. The pickles were a nice start. I think they could have used a little something more in the seasoning but the homemade ranch was great! They use fresh herbs in what seems mostly sour cream. Very fresh tasting! For my meal I got the pub burger and upgraded my fries to poutine. When ordering our waitress did not ask how we would like the burgers cooked, but to my delight it came out perfect! Still a little pink in the middle and not dry at all. If you like your meat well done, you should specify, but also rethink your life choices. The bacon pub cheese that comes on top was so delicious too. The poutine made me a very happy girl as well. I finished my entire plate! Now if you are looking for traditional poutine this isn't it. Instead of those squeaky cheese curds, they use soft fluffy ones, the stuff that you can make cheese out of. Someone called it feta in their review.. it absolutely ain't feta. I personally do not like those little squeakers, but I would understand being disappointed if you do. Excellent food, really fun, spooky, but still classy decor!"", 'I really wanted to like this place, but it fell a little short for me. Nothing was bad enough for me to say don\'t go here, but we had some issues that prevent me from recommending it. We popped in around 1 on a Saturday and were told there was a 30-45 minute wait but got added to the mobile text waitlist. I got the text that said we were third in line so we window shopped nearby for a bit. 30 minutes later we popped back in to see what the wait was and they said ""oh the hostess here before was new and didn\'t actually add you to the system."" ...mmkay so how do I have a text? Either way, they apologized for losing our reservation and sat us immediately at a communal table. (3 of us at a table for 8 that may or may not add more guests during our meal)The ambiance is great although the music was a bit too loud so everyone was shouting and it was the volume level of a crowded bar. The waitress was kind and took our order quickly. After what seemed like a while she came back and said that somehow the kitchen line had lost our ticket so we had to place our order again. First they lose the reservation, then the order? We were hoping they\'d lose our check too but nope. They did offer my husband a complimentary second beer, but he only wanted the one. Nothing was comped on the bill. Anyway - his hash was tasty but a very small amount of hash. Moms burger was good and came with a boatload of French fries. Attached is a photo of my blackbird breakfast sandwich. I\'m an idiot and didn\'t realize it came with buffalo sauce which isn\'t my favorite, but that mistake is on me of course. The potatoes were generously seasoned and delicious. Not our best experience but could\'ve been a fluke day. I like to give the benefit of the doubt. I\'d probably give it another shot if I\'m back in the area for lunch or dinner instead of brunch.']",positive

I ordered the Crab Patty, Oxtails with Collard Greens and Yellow Rice, and Key Lime Pie. The wait was longer than they said it would be and the food was not worth the wait.I saw a customer (obviously a regular) ask the staff to heat up their patty so it was hot as they wanted to eat it immediately. When I asked for the same thing, I was told the patties were hot and didn't need any reheating (as they came out of an obviously only luke warm holder). I as I bit into my Crab Patty, it was not hot. The crab in the patty was also fake and the pastry to filling ratio way off, as every bite was 3/4 pastry and only 1/4 filling.The Oxtails were extremely fatty. I've been to other places and the oxtails in those places are obviously stewed longer so the fat is rendered off. Not here. If you order the oxtails, be ready for a mouth full of gross feeling beef fat. The flavor was ok, but the amount of fat left on the oxtail was incredibly off-putting.

I loved how they give you an assortment of toppings, the garlic topping elevated my ramen so much!I would of preferred my noodles thicker. But these freshly made thin noodles tasted so good I ordered an extra refill!Yup my yelp tip is for just $2.50 get a noodles refill. Such a great deal and it beats getting a the double portion ramen which just gives you a 2 slices of meat for $4 more. Its hard to notice on the menu but they have different names for different sized bowls. So get the basic bowls bc all they do is add an egg or 2 pieces of meat which really isn't worth it.

I guess for those who like a lighter more brothy version of Ramen, this is the place to go."", ""It's reasonably priced, service is fast and friendly, and the food is decent.

Tasty and appeasing to the eye.Trip #2We dropped in on a Friday evening (around 8:15pm) and it was dead.- Bread - four pieces of pita buns. Slightly warmed and light. - Chicken platter ($9.99) - the meat was plentiful but this time around, the chicken wasn't the best and I found it over seasoned.

Once we were finished ordering he tells me that his machine is broken so he cannot print me a receipt and doesn't have an GST number. He then goes on to argue with me asking why I need one when other people who order here for work don't need one. He then proceeds to getting angry at me and kept using the excuse that they're a small business to justify why he could not fulfill my request. His attitude came off very rude and short tempered.

We ordered the shawarma chicken platter which came with hummus, greek salad, chicken and rice. Loaded with white sauce and a light drizzle of hot sauce, it was a very oily and indulgent meal because most of the chicken meat was actually scraps of skin. The taste was very good but the grease is still lingerin in my mouth a little bit. The falafel on the other had was amazing. It was crisped brown without being greasy and again, with the sauces felt heavier but the actual patty itself was well formed and delicious without being too salty.

The fried chicken on their most popular sandwich, the Reggie, was beautifully breaded and the sausage gravy was seasoned well and not salty. As one who doesn\'t usually like the ""gravy"" in biscuits and gravy, I asked for it on the side but I could\'ve eaten a container of the sausage gravy by myself! It was that good.The pulled pork biscuit featured their house smoked pulled pork and it was moist and tender. While the barbecue sauce was thinner than I usually like, it was very good. There were so many textures going on with this sandwich with the biscuit, the meat, and the purple slaw. We had it deconstructed for travel and that was great as otherwise, it would\'ve been soggy, particularly with the bbq sauce.Our two-stack of cornmeal pancakes were thin and light but they were good and full of blueberries. The plain biscuits topped with their apple butter, which tasted like the best applesauce, was so good. The meat biscuits were alright but coming from the south, the ham was not ""country ham""!

Maybe order different things. My wife got the veggie biscuits and gravy. She was a big fan. Biscuits and gravy is her love language so these fit the bill perfectly. Added our own egg at home. I got the Chatfield. I love me a good sweet and salty combo. I love that the chicken is perfectly sized and about as uniform as you can get without being suspicious. The Apple jelly is perfect with it. You're gonna have to try pretty hard to talk me out of this. I actually got dessert. Pine state is usually not a sit down and enjoy dessert type of place but I can in the comfort of my own home. We got the hot buttered rum pop tart and the caramel apple. I love the crispy crunchy tender flaky crust of the pop tart. I wasn't a huge fan of the hot buttered rum. The filling was tasty but just odd. I was a big fan of the caramel apple one though.

We all ordered the French onion soup to start, which was unfortunately bit of a disappointment (especially after waiting for the better part of an hour). The presentation looked sloppy, and the flavour was not much better either - the broth was so salty to the point of nearly being undrinkable, and the onions where both bland and overcooked. Unsurprisingly, all of our soups were left unfinished.Despite the restaurant slowly emptying out (it was approaching 2:30 by now), our second course took yet another 20 minutes after our bowls were taken away to be served. Two of us ordered the beer-battered hake, and one of my friends had the braised lamb neck. The hake was fantastic and by far the highlight of the entire meal - perfectly fried with a deliciously soft, flavourful interior and a wonderfully crispy batter. The mac and cheese side was disappointing - pasta overcooked and drenched in sauce.We waited a further 15 minutes for our desserts (and at this point, the dining room was literally empty except for our table!), and perhaps we'd have been better off without them. Rhubarb sorbet was surprisingly tasteless - neither naturally sour nor well sweetened - and we couldn't really eat more than a few bites. The carrot cake hit the other extreme - certainly sweet, but nearly sickeningly so.To top off this marathon 3-course lunch (2 hours and counting already), it took us another 15 minutes to get the attention of a server to pay the cheque. Price point was lower than normal already, considering the special Dine-out Boston menu, but for this quality of food and service, definitely much more than I'd consider reasonable.Overall, an extremely disappointing experience (and surprisingly, too, considering the generally positive comments I've heard), and it will be a hard sale for me to return again."", 'This review is for drinks at the bar only. I haven\'t eaten here so I can\'t speak to the food. TL;DR: pretty good drinks but weird drink menu and options. No beers on tap and batched cocktails. My friend E and I popped into Harvest for drinks on a Saturday afternoon and had a nice visit. It was fairly early so there weren\'t many people and we got seats at the bar right away. Decor and ambiance is cozy and I liked that the entrance is tucked down a little brick alley. Very Harvard Square. The bar tender was friendly and attentive plus she always kept our water glasses full. Love that. I was a bit underwhelmed by the menu. There were only a couple cocktails and when I went to order one I was told that they ""hadn\'t made them yet"" which is fair since it was early and the bar just opened, but also means they batch their cocktails. Not a deal breaker but good to know if you\'re a cocktail connoisseur and that\'s a big deal for you. I did like that they had several tasty sounding mocktails. The wine list was pretty good with a few options each of red, white, rose and bubbles, plus an extensive bottle list. The beer list was quite disappointing. First off they have nothing on tap. The bar clearly has taps built in but they weren\'t in use. Although they had maybe 20 beer options more than half were $20-30+ oversized bottles so you\'re committing to 2-3 glasses of the same beer. Just weird. A few times I felt a bit of a chilly breeze but just figured it was due to people coming and going on a windy February day. Nope. When we left both doors (cause there\'s a small foyer area specifically to prevent drafts) we\'re propped open. In February. In Boston. I actually don\'t know what they were thinking. Ultimately we did like the drinks we had but I wouldn\'t come back just for drinks given the limited options. Some food I saw passing by looked quite good so I\'d consider coming back to try a meal.', ""The restaurant is tucked away in the middle of a large concrete building on the street level. The restaurant cannot be seen from the street but you will find a fold up sign so you know you are going in the right direction. When you walk inside the concrete structure, anthropology should be on your right. Surprisingly they had a patio seating with space heaters. We elected to sit inside because it was freezing out but the area looked really nice, you could tell some folks were cold because they were still bundled up. We sat in the back area, which takes you through part of the kitchen. It was nice to have an open kitchen but you have to walk thru the area where the servers are picking up the food which felt a little chaotic.The food overall was good but nothing amazing for 125 per person wine pairing (dinner only was 85pp) for the nye prefix menu. We started with the crab stuffed devil eggs which were pretty good. I can always go for a good deviled egg. The appetizer I chose was the oysters Rockefeller and wifey got the potato soup with caviar. The oysters Rockefeller was okay, I really like Abe and Louie's oysters Rockefeller where the spinach, and bread crumbs are melted and combined with the oyster where this one felt like they were just separated components in one dish. The soup was tasty though, the caviar didn't really add anything to the dish. Wifey got the scallops (the best dish) and I got the filet mignonette and escargot. The scallops were seared well and was very well presented. It was the best dish of the night. My filet was cooked to a perfect medium rare but it was not seared so the texture wasn't the most pleasant. The escargot was deshelled and didn't have much texture to it. The mashed potatoes were very creamy and delicious. For dessert, wifey got a pomegranate sorbet (very good) and I got the chocolate cake. The chocolate cake was very heavy and rich, it came with a coffee ice cream. It was good but too heavy for me. If I had a do over, I would've ordered wifey's dishes."", ""Three stars based on their prix fix Thanksgiving dinner. TLDR: Food was mostly good, but our service was a bit sub-par. We were greeted and seated promptly for our 5:45 reservation and they even asked if we wanted to be seated indoors or on the heated patio. After waiting some time passed, our waiter rushed over, apologized for the wait and asked if we were ready to order - no introductions or information. Given the prix fix menu we assumed this was normal so we went ahead with our full orders. The appetizers came out, but we were told the bar was still making the cocktail that was ordered. I got the potato soup, the portion was on the small side but it was very tasty. My fiancé got the oysters and was very pleased. \xa0However, the cocktail didn't come out until after we were done with our appetizers and it was ok, but very tart so we watered it down. I ordered the turkey dinner entree, which was supposed to have roasted brussel sprouts, but came out with plain, steamed broccoli. I noticed another table was served cornbread, but we weren't. When the waiter came by to check in I asked for more gravy and right as he went to rush off again I asked about it so they eventually brought two small pieces of corn bread over. The dinner was fine, but not overly exciting. The broccoli was bland, the cheese mashed potatoes mostly just tasted like potatoes (but still good). The stuffing was supposed to be bacon and pear brioche, it was a little on the dry side and my serving had 1 small nugget of bacon and no pear. My fiancé ordered the salmon. The fish itself was very good, as were the onion and golden beets. It was served skin-up, so just keep that in mind. For dessert we got the chocolate pecan tart, the shell seemed slightly over cooked, but otherwise good with a nice presentation. We also ordered the pumpkin toffee crumb cake, which was very confusing. It was essentially a small cupcake sized piece of pumpkin bread, doused in toffee sauce but we couldn't find the crumb. Had we realized, we would have ordered it without the toffee sauce because it was so insanely sweet, we basically dug out the middle. Another table was eventually seated next to us and besides introducing herself, the waitress took them through the menu, mentioned the mysterious cornbread and some other ordering options that we couldn't quite hear. Later I asked about the broccoli situation and found out they ran out....this was shortly after 6pm. \xa0It was a nice night, but given the cost of $85/person + tip/tax, it fell a bit short of our expectations."", ""I've heard good things about Harvest but unfortunately my experience wasn't great. Our service was pretty slow for the most part and at one point our server switched roles and started bartending and we were left unattended for a good 25 minutes until we flagged someone down and got a new server.I ordered the harvest burger (with an impossible patty) at lunchtime. The patty was so over-cooked and dry and they forgot to put the mustard aioli on it so that made the burger that much more dry to eat. Since our server got held up elsewhere and we were in a quieter part of the restaurant, I didn't have a chance to ask for the mustard so I ended up needing to just add some of the ketchup that came with my side of fries.The fries were good, nice and crispy, but I was pretty let down by the burger.Others in my group enjoyed their food but another person that got the impossible burger has the same issue as mine.Harvest does have a good wine and spirits selection."", ""Really excellent service and great food. We ate here for brunch and had a really delicious burger and fries that was so juicy and tasty. Don't be scared off by a restaurant with table linens, this place is approachable and a great relaxing atmosphere for friends to gather. On a rather cold winter morning I was surprised by the number of people requesting to sit on the heated patio. A little cold and bleak for my liking so we sat inside but everyone outside seemed to be enjoying themselves. One other shoutout - as a tea drinker I really appreciated the proper pot of loose leaf tea that was brought to the table and the server refreshed with more hot water without being asked. Nice touch that is appreciated by someone that feels like tea drinkers are often forgotten or an after thought. This is a great brunch place and somewhere I would be back to for dinner."", ""This place was so difficult to find because it's kind of tucked away in a little alleyway. But once I finally figured it out and got there, I was pleasantly surprised by the super cute patio they had in the back. It was a gorgeous day out, so perfect for outdoor seating. Even though it was super warm and sunny, the awning they had did a good job providing a lot of shade so you didn't have to worry about getting burnt! My friend and I came here on a Friday afternoon hoping to have brunch but they only serve brunch on the weekends. The regular menu is quite small and a little on the pricey side. We were both feeling a burger so we got the Harvest burger. It was a really good burger that I enjoyed; nothing crazy or special, but it definitely filled me up. I would recommend. For a drink I tried the Harvest Sangria which was so delightful and refreshing especially on a warm day. As for service it was just alright. But overall I did enjoy this place and would definitely come back for the cute atmosphere of the patio. Would love to try the brunch."", 'Cute place for a Saturday brunch with your girlfriend! The restaurant is elegant and has a very nice patio.Food is very good. The fried chicken and waffle is over the top!!I really did not care much for the oysters. They did not taste fresh or maybe they were just to warm for my taste. Perfect for graduation brunch and dinner!', ""This place is good for lunch. If you're in Cambridge or even if you live here, you should come here. The ambiance is good and the decor is good. We got the Burger with fries and I must say their fries are amazing. The burger is also great and it has a good grill taste with the burger. The staff are very friendly and when I went it wasn't busy and we got in instantly.""]",negative
"['We had a delicious yet quick meal at Tin Drum Asian Kitchen. \xa0The gentleman who took our order was friendly and made great recommendations.

Amazing whisky selection and draught beers. Servers were extremely friendly. My dining companions had the salmon and the cottage pie; both looked and tasted great.

"['I\'m so used to the grocery store sushi and the buffet sushi where the sashimi is about the size of a postage stamp.But here, the sashimi on the nigiri sushi reminds me of the early days of sushi in the United States - and sushi in Japan - where the sashimi is about 1"" by 4"".

The food, where to start! \xa0Apps:1. Assorted Tempura; delicious and crunchy! Its flavorful and the sauce is like the icing on the cake. It's basic and simple.2. Agedashi Tofu: The Tofu is perfectly fried, lightly enough to the point its melty! The sauce it sits in is delicious and I can drink a whole bowl.3. Karrage: Chicken is always cooked perfectly. Moist and flavorful.Sushi Rolls:1. Avocado roll- simple, and for only $2.20- worth every bite.2. Spicy Salmon Avocado; best basic roll with fish! Absolutely loved 3. Rainbow: the array of fish is perfection and I love the variety4. Scorpion; I love being able to get this and its a great combo! Gunkhan:1. Creamy Scallop; yum! must try and I was pleasantly surprised! 2. Krab Salad; I love this because it reminds me of a CA roll without as much rice! 3. Inari; yummy vegetarian option! and its slightly sweet Nigiri: Salmon, Sea Bream, Salmon Toro, Bluefin Toro, Eel, Tamago. ALL fishes whether it is the fresh catch of the day or not; is phenomenal. it is ALWAYS fresh to me. Love coming here just for this! Entrees:1. Oyako Don- this is like chicken and rice. The chicken is TENDER and melt in your mouth. The egg is perfection and the sauce is delicious.2. Katsu Don- perfectly fried and delicious! The sauce and rice I could eat every second until every grain is gone! 3. Hot Udon: this is a great addition on a cold, rainy day! Its simple, but the taste is a bit more fishy! Desserts:1. Japanese Pudding; its a petite dessert that is delicious and not overly sweet2. Matcha Parfait; i got the mini and it was a perfect portion for one person.

That definitely discouraged me from ordering that item since I have no idea what I\'m getting. So I ordered the katsu-don (pork cutlet rice bowl with undercooked egg) since it was good in the past. To my surprise, the katsu was flavorless and there was barely any sauce that should be poured on top of the rice. The pork katsu curry rice was the same thing. The katsu had no flavor and the curry tasted watered down. The scorpion roll that we had was mediocre, probably only slightly better than conveyor belt. I am not sure if the ownership changed over the years or the quality went down. This was definitely not the same quality place I remember it being. Would I go back? Probably not.

"[""Everyone in my group was thoroughly satisfied with our meal at Little Donkey--we got a wide array of tapas and literally everything was good. Usually with tapas I find that a few dishes are standouts, but out of everything we tried I'm not sure I could even pick a favorite, because it was all so good. We tried the octopus, the kale saag, the waygu steak tartare, the BLT lettuce wraps, the manti, and a slew of other dishes. They recommend 2-3 per person, but we got just under 2 tapas per person and were pretty full by the end. The portion sizes are generous. I don't think it's easy for one restaurant to serve food from 5+ different cuisines and have everything be good, but Little Donkey pulls it off. The meal was definitely on the pricey side, so I don't think I'll become a regular here, but the food was absolutely worth the splurge."", ""(+1) This is the perfect restaurant to go to if you want a sit down restaurant for conversations.

The noodle portion is pretty generous and they were like a fun twist on pad Thai. The Parker house rolls were as delicious and soft as others have described.The empanadas were okay- a good shareable item but nothing really unique or special.

Had no trouble with getting a reservation online.The inside of the restaurant is DARK. Almost to the point where you can\'t read the menu (the people seated next to us needed to use their phone flashlights). No candles on the table either to provide some sort of light.

They also really pack you into the restaurant so it was a little difficult to get in and out of my seat.We ordered 2 drinks and 5 dishes as the recommended amount was 4 dishes for two people. We ordered the Queen of Troy (subbed for tequila) and the Garden of Snakes. Both drinks were decent and refreshing. However, it was nothing too special and we didn\'t finish the whole drink because it came later than some of our food. Then, the rest of our dishes came so fast that we barely had a chance to enjoy our drinks.For starters, we ordered the wagyu tartare and the BLT. The wagyu tartare came on a crispy potato and the mixture was decent. It was pretty expensive ($21) for the size though. The BLT was interesting because of the lamb bacon but overall way too salty.The celery noodles were my favorite dish of the night because of the intentional creativity. It was served with a crab bisque and the flavors had depth. The celery was also cooked in a way that I\'ve never experienced before.Our other two main dishes were the hand cut noodles and the fried chicken sandwich.

Yes it can be pricey, but given the great combo of food, drink, atmosphere, and service, I'd say it's worth it.

We ordered the hand cut noodle, snap pea salad, wagyu steak tartare, and Kowloon fried cauliflower. All of the dishes were flavor packed, but heavy on the sauce. Some of the dishes, especially the wagyu steak tartare, could have gone without as much sauce and spice as they overwhelmed the other more subtle flavors. My favorite was the hand cut noodle as it was the lightest of them all, with just enough chili oil and lamb to coat the noodles. The noodles had phenomenal texture and the lamb was flavored well with chives. As for the other dishes, the cauliflower was fried perfectly and the potato base for the steak tartare was unique and surprisingly fitting for what it was. Fair warning: The dishes were small, and we ended up paying $82 as a party of 2 not so hungry people. The place was busy on Friday for dinner, but a little loud and way too dark to even see what I was eating. I had to shine a flashlight whenever food arrived at the table to see what it was. Otherwise, service was high quality: great recommendations and food came out at a steady pace."", ""Absolutely fabulous! Great small plates packed with flavor!

Spicy cauliflower is good but definitely spicy!', ""Went on a quiet Wednesday night and experienced prompt service.

"[""I've walked by this restaurant a number of times while visiting Vancouver and finally had a chance to pop in and give it a try.

The spring rolls had a great filling to wrapper ratio and provided the perfect crispy, crunch spring rolls are known for. The vegetarian salad roll had fried tofu in addition to cabbage, cucumber and bean sprouts. Both appetizers were delicious and fresh. The vegetarian pho is hands down the best pho I've ever had. The vegetable broth was delicious and full of flavour. It was a huge serving for a small. A ton of vegetables and the crispy tofu was appreciated.

Now, I've been to a lot of pho places, and I've never just been served ONE piece of spring roll cut in half... but BEWARE that when you order a spring roll, you are literally getting ONE tiny spring roll cut in half.. it's..the craziest thing I've ever seen that I laughed out loud when it came out. As for their pho, it was decent enough. Altho, when the tendon came out.. it had like 3 pieces in there.. they're def not generous on the meat. Definitely wasn't the best experience at this place.

I have had Ethiopian at several other places with the same amount of food for literally half the price. That said, the appearance of the restaurant was exceptional and very professional.

The restaurant appears to have the building to itself so there was plenty of seating inside although at the time I went, there was only a few people inside so not sure how packed they get later in the day. There was also a bar area with seating as well. Service: I have to agree with other reviews, service could use some work. Not exactly the most welcoming feeling especially being that it wasn't packed. I said thank you as my food was being handed to me but the waitress just dropped the bag off and kept going. Food: I ordered a sambusa which was just okay. Also ordered the sampler which had a nice flavor. It comes with the bole tibs, bole awaze tibs, and a variety of veggies including cabbage, lentil, greens, potatoes, beets. A side salad was also included. Overall a solid choice for a first timer.

I should have sat in traffic the hour plus to go back to the place we ate at before all the way across town. The interior is nice. I love the pictures on the wall and the informative messages and photos on the table tops. That\'s where it stops for me. Staff: Only one young lady working in front. She told us we could sit anywhere we like. Came and asked us what we wanted to drink. Returned with our waters and asked if we were ready to order. We needed a minute and said we would be ready when she returned with our waters. We waited \xa0-- and we wait for her return. And we wait. --Service: The young lady returns. We order a lamb dish only to be told they ran out of lamb the day before. We have questions about preparation and if tomatoes could be removed from a dish because they make my boyfriend sick. She says ""yes, it can be prepared without tomatoes."" Great. I ask about the cheese that comes with a dish and it\'s explained that it (feta) couldn\'t be removed so I pass on it. My second choice came with cheese but on the side so they could serve it without it. Great. *** NOTE- there are only three tables with guest, five people total in the main area excluding ourselves. One person in the bar area. --- We wait. --- We wait. \xa0Food: Finally, our food arrives. I check out my boyfriends dish and I notice it had tomatoes in it. Then I ask myself, \xa0""Did they run out of lettuce?"" His salad serving was approximately two tablespoons. He only ordered beef since they were out of lamb and there were still tomatoes in his food. Our server notices the tomatoes and say ""Oh. Is it ok. You can pick them out. --- I wanted to say something but he rolled with the punches on his birthday. The portion was smaller than we had gotten at the other restaurant but, every restaurant is different so fine. He said it was seasoned and not bad once he took out the tomatoes. Now let\'s talk about this chicken dish I ordered. *** DISCLAIMER- I do my very best not to rant and get overly emotional however I ask that you give me this moment. -- Maybe it\'s me but I have never been to a restaurant that served a regular size portion of chicken legs with only one leg. You read that correctly--- ONE CHICKEN LEG! I ordered the stewed chicken soup. It is a thick tomatoes paste dish which was chalky. It tasted as if it had too much chili powder in it. If \xa0I\'m honest I expected more from the dish itself. I feel like I\'ve made something very similar at home and Lord knows it tasted better. And i make it with a minimum of 8 - 10 chicken legs. ---- ONE CHICKEN LEG AND I POSTED A PICTURE TO PROVE IT!A gentleman at another table had a colorful drink so we decided to ask our server (when she finally returned) what it was and decided to order one. Before leaving the table she asks us how we were liking our food and it must have been the look on our faces or lack of excitement that told her she didn\'t want to know and---she simply walked away not even waiting for our response. Later, she returns with our drink--- not once has she asked if we wanted or needed any more water. She did not refill our glass the entire time we were there. (Or the people around us. So her lack of service was consistent.) --- fresh squeeze ""juice"" that was more like a smoothie. By this time we agreed this had not been a good experience. I don\'t even eat a lot and I said I need something else (ONE CHICKEN LEG REALLY)! You would think nothing else could go wrong. I ask for a to-go container for my food. Our server brings me a to-go plate. Not a bowl for this tomato paste like soup but a styrofoam, three compartment to-go and a plastic cake container. So I ask for a to-go bowl. She said what she gave me would work. -- I looked at my boyfriend and took a deep breath-- I explained to her that it would spill in the containers she gave me and asked for a to-go cup with a lid, as it would work better. She leaves and comes back with a plastic cup. Fine-- the soup was no longer hot so it worked. She leaves. We wait-- We wait. I finally got up and asked for the check. She hands it to me--- I sign it reluctantly. No, I did not leave a tip. (I tip based on service--- I start at 20% and my servers earn more or less from there.)Cost: Please see attached pictures. I am not exaggerating. THAT ONE CHICKEN LEG COST $16.99. The cubed beef served in a side dish with two spoonfuls of ""salad"" was $14.99. Overall, I cannot recommend eating here and I will not be returning. *** And by the way. We did leave there and go somewhere else to eat. I ended up putting the left over ""soup"" on some lamb I cooked at home the next day.', ""This is a hard review to write. I have such conflicting feelings but I wanted for the potential clients to know that we sat there for over an hour before we got ANY food.

"[""I love Dolphin Bay! Always a great place for Taiwanese food. Their bubble teas are the best. My favorite is the hot ginger tea, it just refreshes the soul!

I stopped by with a friend around 7pm on a weekday to a generally empty restaurant - only a few other tables were occupied - and service was very prompt, from being seated to ordered and getting served. Overall, food was certainly not bad by any means, but perhaps my high standards for Taiwanese cuisine left me a little disappointed at the end.Beef noodle soup was definitely the highlight of the meal - the broth was a little less rich/savoury than most beef noodle soups (a bit more like the flavour of Taiwanese steamed/marinated pork jus), but delicious nonetheless, with nicely cooked noodles and tender cuts of beef. Popcorn chicken was also quite tasty - well seasoned and juicy bites - paired with yummy tofu and veggies on the side.Our other dishes were mediocre; the spicy wontons, the oyster omelette, and the beef stuffed pancakes (all signature Taiwanese dishes, mind you) were passable. They weren't particularly tasty, and in particular the wontons and the pancake didn't really taste fresh or authentic.Price point was considerably higher than I expected though - and certainly higher than I think the quality and quantity merited.

But I left disappointed and am surprised Dolphin Bay expanded from California where competition would be high. I had the beef noodle soup and popcorn chicken. The balance of noodles, beef, and vegetables was perfect. But the food was tasteless and underwhelming. I also got a spicy popcorn chicken, but it wasn't spicy at all.

We ordered the Beef Scallion Roll as an appetizer and it was good. If you're a fan of Scallion Pancakes you will love this dish. For the main entrees, we got the Popcorn Chicken Rice and the Noodle Soup with Fried Pork Chop.

The jasmine tea has a perfect dolphin shape. I love it! Perfect and refreshing drink. The wontons are 10/10, so juicy, so soft and just melts in your mouth. I substituted the white noodles to rice noodles, and it was so yum. It was a good subtle regular spicy. Not dying spicy and not flavorless.

We were seated and orders were taken immediately.We both opted for the sushi lunch special.Which includes various sushi rolls and the miso soup+ ginger salad.($13-$15)The soup and salad are standard and enjoyable.Our sushi rolls came out, the presentation was great.But the amount of rice on the rolls were overwhelming. I get that they want people to be full/satisfied but for me it was a bit much.The roll that we both really enjoyed was the midtown special roll. (YUM)Over all, we were content but with the multitude of sushi places around, it may be a while before we head back to this spot!"", ""Didn't know there was a Ru Sans in midtown. Ordered through the Door Dash app. Ate the Japanese Roll first and put the rest in the fridge. A few hours later I went back and ate the rest. I awoke to some terrible cramps. I drank some water and took some TUMS. About 15 minutes later, I was vomiting everywhere! And diarrhea!! NEVER AGAIN!!! I DONT SEE AN UPDATED HEALTH SCORE FOR THEM, BUT I USUALLY DON'T EAT A PLACES THAT HAVE ANYTHING LESS THAN A 'B' SCORE. FOOD POISONING IS WHAT I HAVE! I'm waiting now to contact them and Door Dash! Will not be back!"", ""Ordered via UberEats. I think it was okay in terms of take-out sushi and beats premade sushi you could buy at a grocery store. I ordered the Spider Roll and the Girlfiend (yep, not a typo) Roll. I also got the Zucchini Tempura. The spider roll consists of fried soft shell crab, imitation crab meat, cucumber, and masago. Soft shell crab was crispy, but this roll is kind of large, so it falls apart when you pick it up with chopsticks. I unfortunately found some eyelashes in this roll, and had to toss some of it. The girlfiend roll reminded me of a dragon roll as it had a variety of colors of fish and includes tuna, yellowtail, salmon, avocado, sea eel, and eel sauce. I would say this one was my favorite. The Zucchini Tempura was surprisingly still acceptably crispy by the time I got it, and it comes with a generous amount of tempura dipping sauce. I was also disappointed that there was not miso soup to go, or combos with sushi that included miso/side salad. I would say, give em a try if you're looking for sushi takeout during this time, and there aren't a ton of options open, but also be aware of some of the issues as well."", ""Ever since I found out there was a Ru San restaurant in Atlanta, I was determined to visit. I'm very familiar with the Charlotte location, seeing that I have held the Duchess title every so often (soft brag). I was hoping my favorite rolls would be available at this location in Atlanta. They were not, but I didn't mind because it forces me to pick other specialty rolls. I did see some similarities in the menu. First I tried ordering sea bass tempura, but they were out of sea bass at 4pm in the afternoon. I brushed that off and decided to try two rolls. My lunch partner went with the fried rice (if you've had Ru's fried rice, you know it's hard to beat) and the Kirin Roll.The rice was very good, as I expected. I talked it up to her, so I was relieved that it's almost as good at this location. Ru San usually creates bigger than average sushi rolls, but the Kirin Roll was huge! Eating that with chopsticks was a struggle. It was good, as were the two (Love Me/Doing it) rolls I chose. The Long Island Iced Tea was pretty strong, so if you like that drink, be sure to order. I was less pleased with the $1 charge for a side of eel sauce. I've eaten at numerous sushi places and have never been charged before. I quickly got over that until I tasted the sauce which was a little bitter and runny.All in all, I enjoyed my meal. I will return on a future trip, but I'll try one of the other locations to see how it compares to this one."", ""I placed an order here to go for my favorite sushi roll. I hadn't tried Ru San's before so I was a little worried about the prices but it was late & they were open so I did it anyways. The roll of sushi that I received approximately 15 minutes later was the ABSOLUTE FATTEST God-tier roll of sushi I have EVER HAD. Don't worry about what their menu prices are - they're that way for a reason!"", ""Ru San's is a casual and inexpensive Americanized Japanese restaurant with several convenient locations. As a stingy college student, I used to frequent the Athens location. While biking on the belt line, we got hungry and decided to bike to this location - I was super impressed with the location. Very easy to get to (whether by bike or car) and there is ample parking, along with a bike rack. Note that you do have to go upstairs to get to the restaurant from the parking lot. We wanted to try their lunch buffet, but we learned that they no longer offered the lunch buffet. I'll let you Google why.Service is on point. This place was insanely busy for a little after 1 PM on a Tuesday. It appeared that the manager was seating people and helping out, and there was only one server for at least 8 parties. She immediately brought us waters and asked if we had any questions. She was insanely efficient and helpful, considering she had all these tables, had to do all the typical server duties, plus prepare soups and salads for the entrees that included them. Food, however, is a different story. We ordered various rolls off the $1 and $2 sushi menu, in addition to katsudon. Note that the $1 rolls come with 3 pieces, and you have to order 2 for it to be a dollar. So technically, it's $2 for 6 rolls. Which would still be a good deal, since they do have fish options, IF the rolls were good. I found them hard to eat. The ones with sauce had too much sauce, and the sauce was not that great. All of the rolls left me with a weird aftertaste. The katsudon was even worse. Impressed with the portion size, but they put way too much sauce, to the point that it was really mushy and soupy. As soon as we picked up the pork cutlets, they would fall apart. If you know me, I eat people's leftovers and hate wasting food. We could not finish this. I really want to return, since the restaurant itself seems so nice - good staff, good atmosphere, good prices, good location. But I guess you get what you pay for."", ""Ru San has been my go-to for takeout sushi for at least 4 years. Their prices are very reasonable and their sushi is always fresh. \xa0You can call-in or order online which is convenient and there is ample parking in the lot for pick-up. I wouldn't say the staff if super friendly, but for the most part I only interact with them for 5-10 seconds."", 'Ordered the California sunset, Cajun seared salmon and girlfriend roll. Delicious! Fresh salmon and tasty. Found my new favorite spot!', 'Wanted to leave a review after experiencing such great customer service yesterday. I ordered via Uber Eats and my order was incomplete as they forgot to include the sauces I requested. I was pretty annoyed, but decided to drive over to the store to pick up the sauce. After getting the sauce I politely asked if there was any way I could get a refund on my delivery fee or a coupon for next time considering I had to drive to the restaurant myself. Immediately, the cashier offered to reimburse my delivery fee with cash and handed me a $5 bill. I was impressed with the response I got, and will definitely be back! The chicken fried rice was delicious and plenty for 2 full meals. I definitely recommend this place if you are looking for an affordable option for Japanese food and/or sushi in the Midtown area.']",negative
"[""Mother's is an excellent choice for breakfast, brunch and dinner in downtown Portland. There is great atmosphere and the staff is very friendly. My favorite brunch is Salmon Hash and love the macaroni and cheese for lunch."", ""This place is worth the wait. We came in at 12PM and didn't get seated until 1 but boy was it worth it.We ordered mom's meatballs, banana cream Belgian waffle (a must if you're here for the first time), and mom's tiramisu (very very creamy and a large generous slice). Awesome service!!"", 'This is my second time coming to Mother\'s, and I definitely enjoyed it! I remember not ""loving"" it the first time, but the second time really changed my overall opinion of this restaurant. From service to food, everything was really great, and it is a go-to brunch spot if you happen to be in the area.We got three plates of food to share amongst three people and a Strawberry Lemonade. The food was more than enough, and the Strawberry Lemonade also comes with a free refill! I would maybe try out one of their fresh squeezed juices next go around, because I was not too impressed with the Strawberry Lemonade.We ordered a full Wild Salmon Hash (from the Breakfast menu), Peaches and Cream Belgian Waffle (from the ""M.O.M. menu""), and the $15000 Dungeness Crab Cake (from the Lunch menu). The Wild Salmon Hash was served with our option of eggs, and as we were splitting across three people, we opted for scrambled. The Hash itself was pretty tasty. The salmon was not overcooked and had great flavor. The eggs were light and fluffy, and with the addition of the potatoes, it was a very rich dish that was extremely filling. We also got a Peaches and Cream Belgian Waffle that was loaded with peaches and very fluffy whipping cream. However, it tasted excellent, despite the combination of the peaches and cream, which typically results in a dense and heavy sweetness at most brunch spots. Additionally, (what I assume to be) the yeasted waffle dough (because it was ""Belgian""), meant that the waffle was very very fluffy - to a level that I have sadly never been able to achieve at home. There was a side of syrup that we did not even touch, as the waffle was already quite rich with all the other toppings. If you are looking for a sweet dish, definitely give this one a try!My favorite menu item that we ordered was the Crab Cake dish, which was on the Lunch Menu. We went during breakfast, but the waiter stated that they could prepare some lunch items for us. They did not have Dungeness crab that day, and stated that they had to substitute, but I am not a ""crab connoisseur"" so it did not make a big difference to me. The crab cakes themselves were reminiscent of croquettes, and they had a good helping of crab in them. Additionally, they were placed atop a potato bun with slaw that gave it a sweeter and slight acid (from the slaw). It helped cut through the rich fried exterior of the cake itself, and I really enjoyed it. The homemade fries were not that great, so if there is any way to substitute those out for something else, I may consider that when I go back. \xa0The server was really kind and attentive, even though it was extremely busy, so I appreciated her going out of her way to check in on us and make sure that we were satisfied with our meal.', 'Amazing breakfast while in Portland!!Would definitely come back just for breakfast. Even in the rain. Definitely pleasantly surprised!Come hungry!', ""Great food and great service. Mother's doesn't do anything revolutionary in terms of Brunch, but they execute it to perfection. Everything we tried on their menu was delicious! The salmon hash had to be one of the best hashes I've ever had. The salmon was tender and cooked perfectly, and it's mixed with a delicious gravy that was not overly creamy and suited the dish perfectly. The tofu hash was also superb. I'm usually pretty indifferent to tofu but their tofu hash really mixed everything together well. It also felt really clean and healthy!I also loved the ability to order half portions. We were able to get the salmon hash and the French toast in half portions, which allowed us to try more dishes! Wish more restaurants would offer this option. Service was 100% throughout the meal, with the waitstaff being welcoming and ultra efficient. Definitely recommend dining here! You might face a lengthy wait during peak brunch hours but it'll be worth it!"", 'I loved that you could get half orders of some items! I got a half order of biscuits & gravy & it was so good, but also a lot of food still! French toast was really good & omelette was okay to me but my bf said it was good. House potatoes on the side were yummy as well!', ""Honestly, this place is overhyped. We ordered Irish nachos (4/5), chicken liver (0/5), green eggs and no ham (4/5), and the mac n cheese (0/5). The mac n cheese reminded me a little of my childhood- think Kraft boxes, which may actually have more flavor...Overall, the food is relatively flavorless, service is decent. But if you're looking for something unique and packed with flavor, I wouldn't recommend this spot. It aesthetically pleasing, but that's about it. The two stars go to the lattes!"", ""A popular spot for brunch. \xa0There is usually a wait during the weekends, \xa0but it's pretty quick. \xa0This location is much larger than their old one. \xa0They have a full menu of brunch and dinner items. \xa0I had the special - Mexican scramble \xa0with sausage. This was very filling and also good. \xa0The crunchy challah French toast was unique, but good with the crispy exterior texture."", ""This was my 2nd time eating at Mother's, but the past time was in their new location. \xa0There's so much seating now! \xa0It's amazing! \xa0The staff is also amazing!I ordered the French toast, which is always amazing, but added over easy eggs and bacon. \xa0My husband ordered the Double down with corned beef has and biscuits and gravy. \xa0The food was so good and just the right amount.I'm happy to see that people are still eating there and Mother's didn't suffer during the protesting and pandemic. \xa0It would be such a shame because Portland has a lot of amazing restaurants and it breaks my heart to see so many restaurants shutting down. \xa0Please go out and support if you can!"", ""Omg!

"[""I am not a huge fan of pho because the times I tried it, I wasn't crazy about the taste. \xa0I went to this restaurant and was in the mood for soup so I decided to try the chicken pho and I'm so glad I did! The pho was super flavorful and delicious! Now I can say I understand the craze over this dish. \xa0I also got the fresh rolls and they were okay, but I prefer it with only shrimp, not pork. \xa0The peanut sauce was thick and tasted really good.Next time I'm in Chinatown and am in the mood for a yummy soup, I will be having pho in this restaurant!"", ""Not bad. Just okay. There's a minimum of $5 per person. They didn't have the egg soda I wanted because apparently there's only one guy who mixes it and he wasn't there.

You fool me twice, shame on me.""So it\'s been several weeks since my last visit to this place so I decided to give it another chance. \xa0This time again, I came with the same friend who was told he couldn\'t sit in the restaurant unless he ordered at least $5 worth of food (even though the other 3 of us were dining here). \xa0I got another order of their fried rice since I remembered it being really good last time. \xa0My friend decided to order the beef and broccoli.When we went to order, we told the lady what we wanted and she asked, ""Brown rice or white rice""? \xa0My friend asked for white. \xa0We then handed her our card and noticed she charged $27.50 dollars (for 2 entrees that were supposed to be under $20). \xa0A little confused, we asked why we were charged $7+ more dollars. \xa0The lady then proceeded to explain that the white rice was an additional $3. \xa0When one pays $13 for a broccoli and beef entree, rice is expected to come along with it, no? \xa0And, the way she asked whether he wanted white or brown rice made it sound like it was included. \xa0Still a little confused, we asked what the other $4.50 was for. \xa0Once again, the lady tells us that for every take-out item, they charge $1.50. \xa0$1.50????? For take out??? \xa0Who does that!!! \xa0She charged my friend TWO take out fees (1 for broccoli+beef and 1 for the rice!) \xa0Absolutely absurd and poor business practice. \xa0Sure, you might make decent food but scamming customers with poor business ethics is just plain wrong.By the way, the chicken in my fried rice tasted like it was a day old. \xa0Also, my friend\'s beef and broccoli had FOUR pieces of beef and 30 pieces of broccoli. \xa0I guess they weren\'t expecting us back anyways. \xa0I hate you.', ""I think the good reviews of this place must not have anything to do with the pho or the stringent rules. \xa0They are likely remnants of the days of old. \xa0Some quick tidbits:- $5 minimum spent per person at the table- $10 credit card minimum- Checks split in half at the maxThe pho:Definitely noodle heavy. \xa0There's like five pounds of noodles in the bowl with 4 pieces of meat and other random cow particles mixed in. \xa0The flavor is good and the meat is great, but the portions are meager compared to their next door neighbor Pho Pasteur. \xa0The service:Nice folks, attentive and available.The verdict:Probably only come here if Pho Pasteur is too busy."", ""It's been a long while since my first dine in and I was hoping for a much improved experience. Quality of the food was MUCH better, but quality of service still needs a bit of help. I had the cha gao/fried Vietnamese rolls. Tasty, but there was more roll than filling. The Pho Tai Nam was also tastier and not too greasy. Their regular is everybody else's small, but it's priced a little less and I didn't find the portion lacking. Though the sides (bean sprouts & basil) was a tad skimpy, but then again any more wouldn't fit in the bowl! Walking in I was greeted warmly, but the exchanges went downhill from there. I asked for some Thai fresh peppers and was told there isn't any. \xa0I'm wondering if this is a trend towards not catering to these small requests, since this wasn't the only place to state this. Though this surprises me since the cost is in cents rather than dollars. Everybody that served me I said thank you to, with a smile, and I got back nada. Did see the server ask for a tip when the customer was about to leave. This is also a new trend. A tip is for extra service beyond the expected, a lot of servers demand tips now as part of the dining out experience. As long as I've had a pleasant meal, I'll leave a tip, but it shouldn't be demanded of customers!"", 'I visited here a couple of times and my experience here has been very pleasant. Please keep in mind its not the most clean place to eat in but what do you expect from a restaurant in Chinatown??I really like their pho. Noodle is very well cooked, soup is intense, and they give you a pretty good amount of food. If you really want to enhance your pho experience, ask for their ""house special hot sauce/oil"" on the side. This is a good way to control how spicy you want your soup to be. Please keep in mind that it is very spicy. I\'m Korean so when I mean spicy, I really mean spicy. But try putting a little bit in your soup and if you can just get that right amount of hot sauce mixed, man it will rock your world. Trust me and give it a try.I also tried their quail appetizer and I must say it was very delicious. It has that weird distinct smell/taste but they did a really good job blocking that out. Definitely a place to try if you are in the area!', ""Vietnamese food that's not bad but not worth going out of your way for either---#93 (grilled pork steamed vermicelli wraps) i SKIPPED the vermicelli noodles on my plate since they tasted starchy & soggy!! instead i used the rice papers they provided to make spring rolls.

The rare beef pho (XL) is delicious. One of the downsides here is that the size differential between regular and XL is not meaningful, but the price is.

They definitely don't disappoint."", ""I'm tempted to write a two word review: Pho Sate. I live and breathe (and sometimes dream) Vietnamnese food. The pho sate here is enough to occupy my food thoughts for at least 75% of the time since we first made our acquaintance.

It feels like I'm getting plentiful of veggies served in the utmost flavorful broth of them all and my taste buds are definitely spoiled by the tender texture of the thinly sliced rare-rare beef. For under $8, I would come back for this (rarely found) dish anyday and everyday.They also serve beyond the regular pho menu - bun rieu, bun bo hue, bo kho, etc. The service is friendly, fast and awesome.

Upgrade to crispy chicken for an extra $1 and it's difficult to find a better fast-casual meal anywhere in the downtown area. The only pad Thai dish I'm aware of that even comes close to rivaling Siam Bistro's is the one at Empire in Seaport (and it's twice the price)!For someone with an average appetite, the generous portion sizes will leave you with another leftover serving for later.

The result is an Asian fusion smokehouse serving unique takes on some classic items. We called in a fairly large to-go order and then drove over to the location in the South Lamar District to pick up the food. The place was half full for a Monday evening so it wasn't overly busy. There were a couple of outside patios with seating along with a spacious interior dining area that had booths, high-top tables, and picnic style tables along with a bar.Bar Food, Snacks and Veggies, Meats, Sandwiches, Rice Bowls, and Sweets were the menu categories. Our picks were the following...* Crunchy Sweet Corn Fritters (served with sriracha aioli and cilantro)* Crunchy Cabbage Salad (served with cashew-ginger vinaigrette, cucumber, and lemon zest)* Coconut Scented Rice (seasoned with lime leaves and lemongrass)* Tomato & Cucumber Salad (served with cantaloupe, cilantro oil, lemon zest, and mint)* Sesame Rice Noodles (seasoned with chili vinaigrette, black sesame, and green onion)* Malaysian Chicken Bo Ssam (marinated with yellow-curry yuzu vinaigrette and Thai basil)* Char Siew Pork Belly (marinated with hoisin sauce and celery)* Smoked Turkey Breast (served with apricot chutney and chicken skin)* Smoked Beef Brisket (seasoned with chili gastrique and Thai herbs)The standouts to me were the fritters, pork belly, and turkey breast. The sweetness of the fritters was contrasted with the spicy aioli. The pork belly was sliced into small square pieces and coated with the familiar flavor of hoisin. The fruitiness from the chutney and the crispiness of the chicken skin gave a citrus tone and texture, respectively, to enhance the smoked turkey.I do think the meat servings were small for the charged prices. For example, there was maybe a half pound of smoked beef which cost nearly $20. The quality of the meats was good, but I think the brisket was not quite up to the Franklin standard. There had been a buzz about Loro when it first opened in 2018. It has been on my to-do list for Austin, and I was happy to be able to sample a variety of offerings."", ""I love Loro! I've been to their location in Dallas before, but the OG Austin location probably has an even better setup with a larger partially-covered outdoor patio area.I really enjoy casual counter-serve type places like Loro where you just order everything at the bar - easier for big parties like we had too. Loro's draft list and drink options are expansive and fantastic, and you can't stop by here without trying their boozy mango or coffee slushie (they sadly ran out of the coffee slushies when we went ).The food at Loro is some of the best food pairing for casual weekend drinking that I've ever had.

We ended up getting seated 15 minutes later (I think we just got lucky).Once you get seated, you have to go to the front and order and then they bring it out. It gets pretty crowded at the front, so not quite ideal if you are planning on having multiple drinks or ordering more food, so it might be easiest to order all of them at once.I ended up getting the Typhoon and frozen gin and tonic to drink and then shared the crispy potatoes, brisket, brisket rice bowl, and rice noodles.

All of the other food was great and even the brisket in the rice bowl was warm, it was just the brisket by itself.Overall, I was really impressed by the uniqueness and flavor of all of the food and drinks!

Do yourself a favor and sample the different appetizers. Crispy potatoes, chicken karranga, grilled snap peas and the wonton chips and salsa were delicious.

Go to LORO!!! \xa0It is the fusion of both of these fantastic restaurants!!! \xa0I couldn\'t believe the great food and beverages we had here at LORO!We started with the Heifenweis beer on tap which was very good. \xa0We sat at the bar and the bartender suggested the flank steak Meat plate along with the pork belly rice bowl, snap peas and sesame noodles. \xa0I don\'t know what made me agree to order this mess of food but when it came out I was sure happy I did!! \xa0 Our bartender\'s name was Huy and he sure knew his stuff! \xa0The sesame noodles were fantastic!! \xa0Kind of Pho like noodles but with Al dente texture served fried with sesame oil! \xa0FAntastic!!! \xa0Then the flank steak served with pickled radishes and cilantro!! \xa0Really good!! \xa0The snap peas with Kimchi sauce was super tasty but the pork belly rice bowl was the best of the lot. \xa0If you come to LORO\'a you should get this dish. \xa0It\'s hard to explain but it\'s a fusion of thick bacon, rice, some sort of veggies and a \xa0ginger soy sauce that would make you smack yourself in the head if you\'d forgotten to mix it in. \xa0It\'s simply magic. \xa0It\'s ridiculous. \xa0You gotta have it. \xa0We paired it up with an Argentine wine ""Trento Negro"" which was again fantastic!! \xa0 We finished with a cookie that was kinda chocolate chip and kinda macadamia nut mix.... Served with a coffee slush that knocked our socks off!!!Ambiance was Asian smokehouse cool vibes. \xa0Staff was friendly and unbelievably helpful to midwesterners like \xa0us. \xa0Bathrooms were clean and prices were reasonable. \xa0This is 5 star food served in a super cool atmosphere with great prices. \xa0Do not go to Austin without trying this place. \xa0 It should be at the top of your list!!', 'To be very clear, I am a total snob about Asian food. I am like why ruin a good thing by fusing it with other things?? ITS GREAT THE WAY IT IS! HOWEVER! Loro did a great job. I loved the corn fritters and I got the cabbage salad and added grilled shrimp. Everything tasted amazing! I love the atmosphere and I currently work close enough to walk there. Perfect outside seating for the weather when I went. I will have to go back for happy hour. Food came quickly but there were a TON of people so if you are still COVID paranoid, probably just try to take out! Good luck!']",positive
"['Ok, seriously this place has captured my heart. \xa0From the first time I ate in a Cafe in a Nordstrom until now. \xa0This location offers ample covered parking in a garage (located behind Nordstrom) which offers covered parking right into the store.Bazille is located upstairs, to the back of the store (facing the Domain). \xa0Seating is plentiful, and you have the options of the dining room, bar top, bar area or the outdoor patio. \xa0Staff is friendly, the menu albeit is small, offers some great options and they have a stellar Happy Hour menu.On my recent visit I enjoyed the ""Crab, Mango & Avocado Salad"", ($17.75) which was topped with a generous portion of cold crab meat. \xa0The lettuce to crab ratio was on point, the Mangos were fresh (not canned) and the Avocado was perfectly soft and creamy. \xa0I also enjoyed their Cilantro Lime Vinaigrette dressing, which thankfully was not over-powering. \xa0The salad also came with a toasted baguette, which turned out to be two pieces of bread that were clearly Ciabatta, that had been placed on an electric grill. \xa0 Not a fan of the bread, but the salad more than made up for that. \xa0My dining companions ordered (& ENJOYED) the ""Cilantro Lime Shrimp"" salad ($18.75) and the ""Halibut & Chips"". \xa0Both looked delicious and I would definitely order them in the future. \xa0I was especially impressed with the amount of Halibut that comes with the entree ($21).The cafe in Nordstrom is NOT the same cafe that you might recall in the back of KMart. \xa0If you have not been here, you should give it a try.', ""My first visit to Bazille, and I was disappointed in the citrus shrimp salad. \xa0The shrimp were over cooked and dry and there were way too many tortilla strips on top. \xa0It was also a little too small. On the other hand, the bread pudding was great and so was service. \xa0I'll give them another chance."", 'It\'s great to have ""an experience"" when enjoying a meal out or even just a coffee or drink. Nordstrom\'s cafes are that for me. I used to go Christmas shopping at Barton Creek mall once a year with a dear friend. We would always have a delicious lunch at the cafe in Nordstrom. She moved away to Montana, so the opportunity to go hasn\'t been there. The other day, I was shopping at the Nordstrom in the Domain, and decided to treat myself to a small bite and a drink. I had the crab bisque with a salad, and the non-alcoholic berry crush. All were delicious. The great thing about the Nordstrom cafes is that they are typically quieter than restaurants in malls. Also, the cafes are clean which is very important to me. Of course, the prices are higher, but the food is well-prepared and the service is generally excellent. Enjoy!', ""I did not know that there was a restaurant inside Nordstrom! What a great surprise! Staff was very nice! Our server was very knowledgeable and accommodating. I am gluten free and he mentioned they could basically adapta almost anything to my needs. That's really great to hear!! I decided for the salad and it was spot on! Fresh ingredients, seasoned well and the salmon was cooked to perfection. The capers and olives keep it on the salty side, which for me is perfect! However, if you prefer something less salty this might not be the dish for you."", ""Ok-First I'm starting this review with dessert-it's that Good!!!!I detest bread pudding- it's either a soggy bite or dry as a bone. This is the most delicious dessert I have enjoyed...EVER!! \xa0I can't even describe the luscious, silky yet light texture. My daughter described it as French Toast on Steroids. Take a close look!A decadent pyramid like shape-is that raspberry coulees and a creamy white chocolate sauce? Yep, warm and inviting-the fresh whipped cream and beautiful whole fresh raspberries with little mint leaves push it up and over the top-yes we eat first with our eyes but you'll have to exercise extreme self control not to embarrass yourself by licking the plate!If you go for just one item on the menu make it this-I promise you won't be sorry."", ""This place was somewhere I avoided for a long time . When it opened the food was sub par for it's price tag and they where short staffed so you got bad service \xa0. Well one of the two has dramatically improved . I had a hunch I should just give it another shot as we where shopping at Nordstrom's today and saw a rather huge line . I figured either people didn't want to walk to another place in the rain like us or it actually serves good food now .  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0As we sat down we actually had to wait like 10Minutes before our waitress asked us what we wanted to drink so we put in an order for a crab bisque bowl as an appetizer to share and our kids food all at the same time . Then the waitress took another ten minutes to bring our drinks. She said your soup will be out soon and I'll have some bread come out meanwhile . As we waited patiently trying to be understanding about how busy the place is some people sit in the table rite next to us .  \xa0 \xa0 Within a couple minutes the table next to us get their drinks and our waitress brings them bread and butter . She then takes our main order which was steak and frites plus a French dip sandwich. \xa0She then turns goes in the kitchen and comes back to take the table next to ours order . Here we are literally 25 minutes in and don't have our appetizer nor the bread that she promised and our kids are getting fussy . So you can imagine how it kinda felt like a slap in the face to see that she is capable of great service just not with us . \xa0 \xa0  \xa0 \xa0Within a few more minutes another employee brings out a fried calamari appetizer to the table next to us but still no kids pasta ,crab bisque nor bread in site for our table . \xa0As I'm about to say something our waitress nonchalantly walks out with our kids food the bisque and some bread meanwhile the table next to us asks for their second helping of bread and like the flash she turns the corner shuffles around for a second like it's basically on the other side of the wall four feet away and brings them bread within the same minute .  \xa0 At this point I'm just happy to have the soup but not 15 minutes on the dot another wonderful surprise , she then brings the table next to us their food . One dish being a sandwich and the other a grilled salmon . Why does that matter? ? ? \xa0Well ! \xa0Because we had a small 6oz steak and French dip sandwich that takes just about the same time to make as grilled Salomon and a sandwich ! \xa0For some reason our meals where still not out . This is after the table next to us not only arrived ten to twelve minutes after we did but we ordered before there table did . Now I'm thinking what did I do for her to treat us like we don't matter? \xa0I'd been polite and hadn't said one thing as far as how long things where taking . On the other hand the Crab bisque was outstanding , I mean it's something I will always get as an appetizer when I go it's that good . Sad the service isn't as good though . \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Finally at the 55ish minute mark our French dip and 6oz filet steak and frites finally comes out . All I can say is wow it was way better than I ever suspected from this place . My wife absolutely enjoyed the heck out of her sandwich and my steak was perfect . So all I can say is please hire more wait staff , I chalk it up to her being overwhelmed . The entire place had two waitresses to the whole restaurant . Maybe then the service will be as good as the food .  \xa0 \xa0 \xa0I will definitely be back as I really enjoyed the food and i highly recommend a cup of crab bisque or a bowl if anyone is going to taste it because after one taste they won't be able to stop . Follow that up with a steak and frites and I promise you will have an amazing tasting meal \xa0. Honestly it would be a worse rating if the food was really bad and service was great , when they can improve the service this place will definitely deserve the full five stars ."", 'Been here a handful of times. First time I had the margherita pizza which was delightful. Second time we had burgers, so good.

There weren\'t chunks of crab in it, there were tiny bits but the flavor was there. Very perfectly seasoned for my taste.

Yes, that\'s my reaction to eating cilantro even the tiniest bit. Maybe there weren\'t any cilantro in the vinaigrette??

"[""Great little space for a coffee and some food. The flow seems a little confusing if you arrive when it's busy. Seems like it should be running from the door, past the displays and then the till, but during my visit, myself included we ended up bypassing the displays as people were trying to figure out what to eat. I did a flat white, which I am happy to say came with 3 shots in a 16oz. The shots seemed a little short, they might have pulled them a little off time. Also went in for a sour cream glazed doughnut (they may have called it an old fashioned doughnut). Definitely had been sitting for a while, but still same day fresh. Plenty of food options available from snacks to light meals, and they have a small liquor menu too. Service was great. Friendly and welcoming with a warm smile even under the mask. Seating is limited, so you might be taking your order to go, but I assume they setup a patio, or maybe it's wishful thinking, when the weather is better. Hopefully this is a place that continues to be successful. It seems to be popular with the hospital crowd. Backed by the Bosa family, there is a lot of expertise to keep things great.

I really like all the food options whether it's something bigger to have as meal or a little sweet snack.

I opted for the macro bowl this time around which had quinoa, sweet potatoes, beets, and greens. I love Dalina's sweet potatoes, so I scarfed that down really quickly. The bowl was the perfect size and very filling. To drink I got their oat milk latte. I'm usually an almond milk or coconut milk kinda gal, but I've been drinking a lot of oat milk lately and was really happy to see that Dalina serves and carries oat milk. Delicious, delicious, delicious!I love their white minamilistic decor and the pop of colour that the chairs give to the cafe.

Our family had come in from all over to celebrate my mom\'s 70th birthday and we chose Hudson\'s because we trusted they could manage the production of a 14 top; and I must tell you that they managed it beautifully! We were seated upstairs and felt like we had the privacy to really enjoy our time together without disturbing other patrons. Our server was Brittany, and she was absolutely amazing at her job! She communicated well, she remembered everything we requested, and she was always available while remaining in the background. For as many people as we had, I was impressed with the timing of all that we ordered; We all had drink orders, we had calamari and flatbread appetizers, and our main courses were almost all forms of protein that must be timed well in order to be cooked to perfection. The kitchen backed up Brittany\'s serving, and the whole restaurant showed up as the star player in this production! Thank you so much for all of the work you put into ensuring we had the most wonderful family night filled with new memories:)Three complaints:1. There was a female hostess - I wish I\'d gotten her name - who wouldn\'t look at me or acknowledge me when I walked up to the hosting booth, until she finally looked up to say, ""I\'ll be right back."" No smile, hello, I\'ll be right with you, none of that...just three awkward minutes of me smiling, trying to grab her attention, wondering what was happening and why she wasn\'t acknowledging me.2. The wagyu beef burger my daughter ordered was charred and had the heaviness of a hockey puck. It may be that\'s how this restaurant cooks their wagyu burger, but we\'re used to silky, juicy, and tender.3. I ordered a tall greyhound and the pour was heavy; I like to order my drinks tall because I\'m trying to ""water down"" the alcohol with extra juice, and it does sometime happen that I end up with a double vs a tall, which is what this tasted like.None of these things dissuaded my five star review; the ambience, staff, and food is getting a standing ovation from our group for the excellent evening - thank you all so much! I hope your manager shares this with all of you so that you know your hard work behind the scenes did not go unnoticed; in fact, without your efforts we would not have had this most amazing memory to carry with us forever.

Nothing earth shaking, and that goes for the good as well as the bad.Had the Halibut, wife had the Salmon, hers was served with beets that seemed to be pulled right from the dirt and then cooked in the same dirt, dry, fibrous, cooked with as little imagination as possible. Beets take a certain amount of care to cook to perfection, butter comes to mind, as well as wine simmering, we can do better at home in our kitchen so...Our server was told about the inedible Beets, he then came back with the Beet;s unsavory cousins, some of the worst Asparagus ever to be served, huge tough stalks, no discernible flavors, and worse, he announced, ""this is on me.""Tried the happy hour burger a few months ago, far different than the past burger that stood heads above the Cove standard, the ""new"" burger is a fast food look alike and denigrates Hudson\'s reputation to the basement. Better to just drop an item rather than opting to disguise a Carl\'s Jr low ball presentation. I\'m hopeful that the new Thirteen Coins will alert the Couve to good food at good prices, Hudson\'s will either step up or go down as just another failed attempt to cook great food. I get it that the hospitality sector has been hard hit, but that\'s no reason to climb onto the loyal patrons dining table and hang oneself with tacky cooking strategies designed to save a buck. \xa0As a footnote: Most really caring restaurants will have some very real oversight on the cooking side, TASTING, yes that\'s not a new concept but it allows the Chefs to be able to share in the patrons misery--OR delight.', ""Came here for the second time and I ordered the same food. Food was consistently good. Proper temperature and perfectly seasoned. My husband enjoyed the lamb chop as well.

I recommend walking to around in the hotel lobby if you\'re just there for the food. I\'ve eaten there pre-covid and they had a piano player who takes requests. I stayed at the lodge at the beginning of covid and the restaurant only had a few select items for delivery.Most recent we went in for the Dine in the Couv month. I\'ve had their fish, wagyu hamburger and fries, and risotto. All on par! During the most recent visit, the waitress made a comment to my man when he ordered ranch dressing to go with his fries, that he must be a ""kid at heart"", and we were both taken aback, thus the 4 stars.

In fact, I'd get several dishes of the ootoro gunkan and call it a dinner. While we ordered a variety of dishes off the HH menu and received an equal variety for our omakase, we enjoyed our HH picks a lot more. The waitstaff really tried to cater to our taste buds by asking questions, but if you are a picky eater it would probably be easier to just order the dishes you know you like. The sushi at Uchi is more modern, and I've always loved strange and unique combinations - especially when they pair phenomenally. But more often than not, the combinations at Uchi just weren't for me. The experience was dampened by the dark lighting in the main dining rooms \xa0and that it was oh so crowded.

I feel even with their Happy Hour, the prices were overpriced. Def feels like the kind of place to show off you can afford an overpriced meal.I think my biggest thing is that their rice lacks quality. The rice is on the same level any of ole regular sushi place around town. I also think they relay too much on additions they throw in their sushi. For example ""Japanese"" salt ""Japanese mint"", or capers that make their dishes ""unique"". We had the handrolls, uni Santa Barbara, and an ottoro. Uni was my fav. Lastly the interior design really bothered me. It\'s so much going on, red walls with Bali feeling flora vibes. \xa0Kinda dark inside. And then the tables are packed right next to each other, with waiters right on top of you as they collect dishes.

I usually love sitting at the counter but Uchi isn't like most traditional upscale sushi spots. This is the only for walk ins. We were unfortunate enough to sit next to some women who couldn't handle their alcohol. But hey it is what it is. The chefs were all very knowledgeable and tasked with certain things to supply the entire resturant with their sushi. It's incredible they were actually able to somewhat keep up with their tickets that would stretch the entire counter and get us our orders. It did take some significant time in between pieces which is a negative for us and causes the long wait times for the counter. I'd prefer to see reservations for the counter and have that great intimate experience most Omakase or upscale spots would have. There were a few pieces that were exceptionally good, one being the firefly squid and the other was the caviar for me. The sushi was pretty solid but I would say it's definitely not the best in town. There are some great other options that are going to cost you the same, with a great vibe and you won't have to fight as hard for reservations. The waitress and hostess were awesome. They were on top of everything. The hostess was constantly making sure we were good while waiting for our seat. She definitely went above and beyond.

I've also tried their cali club sandwich for lunch before and highly recommended it. One of the downsides to Craft & Common though is that it gets very busy and crowded, especially on the weekends.

"[""Visiting a friend in Boston and decided to grab dinner here after walking the Harvard campus. The restaurant is mid-to-small sized but packs plenty of indoor seating. We were seated immediately for an early (~5:30pm) weekday dinner.Atmosphere: Busy, lively, and modern - still quiet enough to have a conversation comfortably. Seating layout is such that we were able to eat our meal comfortably without significant bothersome foot-traffic near our table.Food: Rich, balanced, and savory - I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen Gyoza combo. The ramen was presented nicely, and I appreciated having the smelted egg separate from the ramen bowl. The broth was flavorful and not overly spicy as to overtake the flavors of the other components in the bowl. The gyoza pieces were a bit of a let down and tasted similar to what you would find in a standard grocery store - milder in flavor and soft, but still provided a palate change.Service: Timely and friendly - Our waitress took our order quickly and accurately, and checked in.Price and value: Affordable and standard ramen quantity. Looking through the window, the bowls seemed small in size, but don't be fooled, the ramen is packed with noodles and other toppings and the bowls are filled. Pictured is the medium size.Happy with the convenience of this ramen shop and hope they come to Houston soon!"", 'This is a very affordable place for ramen. \xa0Get their sets and it came with ramen, \xa0rice and eggs. Definitely try if you in the Cambridge area. Might be a wait but worth it.', ""I went there twice. Once with a friend. I got the miso ramen. It was way too salty and greasy. I sent it back.

He loved it! He ate 2 bowl. I tried something else on the menu. I ordered the fried chicken and some white rice. It was pretty good. The servers are very nice and the food comes to the table pretty fast. The atmosphere is casual and welcoming. Prices are very affordable. We will be returning."", ""I had high hopes for this place since it has so many high reviews and says it's from Japan. We arrived at like 8 but it was packed and had a consistent line of ~5 ppl. It's so weird they ask you to register for the wait list through this app (annoying) but the app didn't work for my friend!??!!! A nice person behind us offered us to use their app to save a spot in line. Because they ask you to use the app, no one acknowledges your presence at the door. We couldn't even ask someone to manually add us in. Tables are quite close together. Maybe that's why they put a basket at the outside ends of the table. I assume it's to let you put \xa0your belongings, but I wasn't interested in putting my stuff out there. It didn't feel safe. There's also the risk of getting food spilled on it. Since I had high hopes, I wanted to try more things so went for the combo. I got shio ramen plus gyzo. The serving platter was cute how it was round with a flat edge. The best part of this meal was probably the soy sauce...It has garlic oil mixed in or something, quite flavorful. The gyoza wasn't pipping hot nor crunchy and had tough skin. Filling wasn't juicy. The soft boiled egg was overcooked. The shio broth showed how the broth naturally isn't flavorful enough. The noodles were too soft and no flavor. My friends got miso and goma miso. I tried both broths. Both not exciting. The goma miso has sesame paste added in which makes the broth thicker and creamier but it felt too heavy for me. Plus the sesame itself wasn't fragrant enough. \xa0Besides being near Harvard and at a cheap price for ramen, I don't want to eat this again."", ""Was looking for some hot food to warm us up after being out in the cold all day - so happy we found them!! Plenty of ramen variety on their menu to satisfy anyone's palate! I had trouble deciding between the Shoyu sauce and the slightly spicy sauce. And lots of appetizers and other options to pick from as well.For appetizer we went with the Karaage. It was pretty good - needs just a tad more seasoning and maybe some different sauces to go with it. We received one mayonnaise condiment packet for it and nothing else - which was unexpected but necessary as it's just a tad bland. But the meat was cooked nicely - very tender and juicy! I got the Cha-Shu ramen with Shoyu sauce. It was also pretty decent - but again, a tad bland for my taste. Everything was cooked very nicely - the noodles were the perfect consistency and the generous helping of pork belly was soft and juicy as well! And in this ramen they gave me 5 pieces of the pork belly!! Very happy about that haha! It was topped with dried seaweed, radish, green onions - all good. But it also had some bamboo I think - and this was extremely tough - I wasn't able to chew it. Otherwise everything was fine.The ambiance is very inviting and staff are super welcoming! Service was excellent - efficient, attentive and helpful. Restaurant was very clean. We were using the subways so am not too sure what the parking situation is - looks to me like it's all street parking - this is a very busy part of Cambridge. But I think there was also a parking garage nearby that I saw. Overall I was satisfied - definitely a comforting spot to warm up with some decent ramen!"", 'For a Friday lunch I arrived at Santouka. Luckily, at 12:15, I received the last remaining seats available. I ordered the Negi Nanban Ramen ($12.75, regular size), and received it within 5 minutes.The portion size seemed a bit small, but understandable given the low tens price point, rather than mid. The noodles possessed decent firmness, though the broth seemed satisfactory yet forgettable. The fried shallots added some fragrance, and the jalapenos made the broth spicy (for Japanese food standards). Lastly, the price did not include a soy sauce simmered egg, which cost +$2.Overall, the meal seemed acceptable. Nothing seemed egregiously off, but nothing stellar stood out either', ""By far the best ramen spot in Boston! Got sat quickly on a weekday during dinner time. The portion size is pretty large so I didn't finish. I got the gyoza combo with karamiso and chicken tonkatsu. The gyozas were fried perfectly and were delicious. The broth was savory and rich! Can't wait to go back."", ""A quick little ramen spot near Harvard Square. It was easy to put our name down on the virtual wait list ahead of time and then walk over with about 5 min remaining. We didn't have to wait at all and then we're shown to our table. Their menu is quite extensive and their default size is medium, but you can select small or large as well.Food came out relatively quickly. I had the toroniku goma miso (sesame and miso) ramen which had a very rich, creamy, nutty broth. Two somewhat tender pieces of pork and the fixings. The broth was a tad salty after awhile, so I couldn't finish it. Overall it was a tasty bowl of ramen with perfectly cooked noodles."", ""AMBIENCE:- I love the flowers they have hanging everywhere. Although the place was bustling and we sat at a long table with other strangers, it still felt very intimate due to the decor.SERVICE: - Service was good and the food arrived quickly even though they were crazy busy.FOOD/DRINKS:-Takoyaki = Amazing. The batter prepared was delicious and cooked to perfection with generous amounts of squid in each ball. - Tonkotsu Shio Ramen + Shiyake Ikura Gohan Combo = Delicious ramen. My 2nd favorite that I've tried in Boston (nothing can beat Gako Ittetsu Ramen). The Shiyake Ikura Gohan was incredibly bland and the salmon was very very dry though, which was such a disappointment since they were on a roll with the takoyaki + ramen.OVERVIEW: - My 2nd favorite ramen place so far! Soup was very layered with general amounts of noodles. Do not get the Shiyake Ikura Gohan, definitely try the takoyaki"", ""My friends and I were craving something soupy one evening, so we stopped by this long-time ramen restaurant in Harvard Square (and until recently, the only ramen place in the neighbourhood). Usually there's a bit of a wait around dinnertime (which is where the Yelp waitlist feature comes in handy!), but when we stopped around 6.30pm on a Wednesday there was a table available\xa0for us.I ordered the cha-shu ramen - which is basically just the regular shoyu/shio/miso (your choice) with extra slices of cha-shu pork. Overall, not bad: noodles were a little too soft for my taste - but the broth was decently flavourful and the pork slices tender and juicy. However, I would say for the portion size, the price point was a little higher than I expected (although perhaps on par for the neighbourhood). That being said, it is one of the few excellent Asian restaurants in the area (with a very convenient location) so I do expect to return soon""]",positive
"['Aficionados of ""authentic"" sushi likely will roll their eyes at some of the options available on Samurai Blue\'s menu. Personally, I am not that snobbish. While I do appreciate a fresh cut of fatty otoro over vinegared riced, sometimes I just want to try something completely gonzo. If you\'re a member of the second crowd, at least part-time, then Samurai Blue is the place for you!Take, for example, the ""Fire in the Hole"" or the Spicy Grilled Eel Roll, both of which we ordered on our last visit. Purists will definitely turn their noses up at the inclusion of avocado, pickled jalapeno and sauteed onion, ingredients bordering on sacrilege. And there are worse ""offenders"" on the menu, for the keen-eyed observer: mustard dressing on the Mango Delight, for example. And let\'s not even begin to discuss the wholly ""offensive"" Sushi Tacos that I ordered (they were delicious, BTW).Hopefully, you\'ve picked up on the snark and sarcasm I\'ve been pouring out, because I love what they\'re doing here at Samurai Blue. Sushi may be a serious endeavor for some people, but it sure as hell can be fun as well! The only cure for ""dishonorable"" is death by sushi seppuku! So sit back, kick off your geta, loosen your obi, and lighten up a bit...at least until you fill up on some crazy sushi concoctions!', ""The hamachi tasted off. The tempura in our roll was burnt and cold and greasy. The worst sushi I've ever had."", 'This is a restaurant I\'ve had my eyes on and finally decided to try with my boyfriend. I had one of their signature rolls the ""Sumo roll"" and I have to say I loved every bite ! It came with 6 rolls which were rather big in size . There was a-bit of a sweet taste to it which I really enjoyed. The tempura flakes on top of the rolls really added some texture to the meal , I would definitely order this again. My boyfriend isn\'t a fan of sushi so he had the chicken teriyaki which was the star of the night. It was sweet and savory and it came with a side of rice which it could have definitely done without . In terms of drinks you have to go to the bar to put in your order unless you knew what you wanted which was a bit disappointing for me. I was hoping to get a cocktail but since there wasn\'t a drink menu I just settled on water. (This is the only reason I\'m giving a 4 star instead of 5)', ""People that have rated this place so highly should always write my performance reviews; they are too nice and generous. Or they don't know good sushi. This was my second and last time ordering here. Sushi is very mediocre, order prep was very average, size of rolls for $17 to $18 rolls was terrible. What a scam? I also asked for extra ginger with every roll and they only gave me a tiny round container. \xa0I had to ask for another and even that was it enough. Go ahead, waste your money there or go somewhere with better sushi and a better value."", ""Like many restaurants, this one seems to have too few servers. Most of the interior dining is not available, with a handful of indoor seats and an outdoor patio outside. You order at the counter and they bring you your order. Service was pretty quick, no complaints!The sushi was slightly above average. I was disappointed after reading reviews. I ordered the sumo and something with fried shrimp. I found that the soy sauce was thin, maybe diluted with water and the wasabi also seemed a bit dull. This also made we wonder where else corners were being cut with my raw fish... It's a cute spot, food was ok, but I am particular about my sushi and do not allow shortcuts to be taken."", ""Sushi is amazing! I got the mango roll. One roll is a large amount and they're fast!

The salmon was lightly fried and not as juicy as I would have hoped, but my friend thoroughly enjoyed her teriyaki chicken. The mildly sweet, tangy dressing on the salad was divine, and the sushi rolls were also delicious. I do wish the containers would have been compostable or eco-friendly containers. Samurai Blue served in clear plastic take out containers and non-compostable plastic forks and there were no recycling bins available when we finished up on the lovely patio/street dining tables.', 'Excellent sushi, appetizers, and drinks!

We had the Rainbow roll, Oregonian roll, spicy Brussel sprouts, poke salad, seared salmon and scallop nigiri (delish) -- all highly recommended.', ""I stopped by for takeout on the way homes. I got two sushi tacos (crunchy scallop and spicy tuna) and a spicy salmon poke salad. I sort of inhaled the food so no pictures. The sushi tacos were generally good. I wish the scallops had been raw, and I found the sauce a bit sweet. The scallops were however perfectly fried and had a good crunch. Spicy tuna one was good. I felt like the tortillas were just a little more brittle than planned. The poke salad was super good though. It had the perfect melange of ingredients and a good amount of spicy salmon.

With that said, it\'s directly off of N Mopac and when the line has even just four cars, you have to drive around the entire building to get in line. Inconvenient, but I\'ll do it for the love of fast fried chicken. I placed an order for eight chicken nuggets with an employee at the drive thru, and progress forward.

I understand how difficult it can be to repeat the same lines over and over all day, so no chirpy attitude needed. Just get the order and move onto the next. The carpool line was quick, and I received my order within five minutes or less since the order was placed. I try a nugget immediately (what\'s willpower good for anyway) and it is saaaaal-ty. Woof. I swear I just took a sodium pill instead of a bite of chicken nugget. The nuggets were also not evenly breaded, so that further confuses me as to why the chicken tasted like the Dead Sea. Albeit all, the nuggets were free since I received a reward in my Chik-fil-a app, so this rating of three stars is a combo of a quick drive thru, verbally lethargic customer service, free chicken, and poor flavor/consistency.

Great balance of flavor and super refreshing. I've already decided that I would come back just for the Papaya Salad.The Spring Rolls were freshly fried and crispy.

As my Chinese wife said, the Boiling Bowl is a ""pho place white people would go to eat."" And I tend to agree.

With a Rainforest Cafe spirit but more of a dinosaur theme, these place screams Disney experience. Wonderful experience and decent food with really great service and full bar. Super duper for a family dinner experience.', ""This restaurant was super cute! It has huge dinosaurs inside that move slightly and create a really fun family atmosphere. The bar area has a huge and beautiful aquarium, which I loved!Food wise, they have a little bit of everything for everyone. \xa0I personally got the mushroom ravioli which was awesome. Our bartender was extremely nice and took good care of us (forgot his name but he has a 2 year old Dalmatian, that his daughter really wanted to get... that should narrow it down). If I'm ever back at springs I'd definitely visit this place again, heads up, if you need a reservation for a bigger party you need to make it weeks in advance, smaller parties/couples should be able to get in easily though !"", 'Ate at the T-Rex Cafe over the weekend and I\'m glad we got there before 11:30am. We were able to eat as a family (16 ppl including kids) and leave before the crowd came. There\'s a variety of food options for the kids which was great. However, they were out of the souvenir cups, so, we purchased the TRex cup holder instead (less expensive so a win for us). A few of the Adults purchased alcoholic beverages (Strawberry Margaritas) - buyer(s) beware - the lid was hard to take off the shaker. Overall, it was a great restaurant to take the kids and they enjoyed the ""show"" - really a 2/3 minute sound and light demonstration.', 'The concept of the restaurant is great, they did a great job with the meteor shower and the dinosaurs that move, etc. Unfortunately, even though the portions are large, the quality of the food is not worth the very high prices they charge. The service was very good and because we went very early we really did not have to wait for a table.', ""You go for the experience not for the food. It's a great experience and kids love it. The aquarium is beautiful and the bar is fun.  \xa0The mozzarella sticks are not great. The chicken finger and fries are basic. My son ate the salmon and shrimp."", ""Very similar to Rainforest Cafe in the experience with a neat store and a fun little sandpit area for kids to play in while you're waiting. \xa0They have a bunch of plastic dinosaurs both inside and outside of the restaurant. \xa0While they're fun for young kids to look at, some of the dinosaurs could use some fixing up. \xa0Most people who go here don't go for the food or service, but for the atmosphere.We had to wait quite a bit to get in line and then we had to wait a bit more once they called us. \xa0And then there was the wait for the food which was awhile also. It's pretty large inside and they've got a decent, but sort've pricey menu. \xa0It's cool to check out once, but I don't think I'd be coming back."", ""Our waitress was not the best, but the ambiance was amazing. Our kids loved watching all of the dinosaurs. On bathroom breaks we took the kids around the restaurant and took their pictures with the dinosaurs. It was amazing! The food was okay, have very low expectations for their food. Other than the food and rude waitress the kids had a great time. Since we did it once, we won't be back to do it again. Oh and we recommend getting an early reservation, it was less busy and more easier to get around the cafe. \xa0We did it for the experience and not their service or food."", ""I have always wanted to go here and finally had the chance! I couldn't find a reservation opening, so we stood in line for a walk in request. My biggest complaint is that the check in process was very disorganized. There was multiple lines and it was very confusing as to where people needed to be. People with reservations were confused why they were in line with walk in people. It was raining, so everything was being taken care of inside. It would've been great if there had been signs as to where everyone needed to stand. Our waitress was very friendly, but it was evident that they were very busy for lunch. Thankfully we still go all of our food extremely fast. I love salmon in general, but this salmon was AMAZING. The sauce was so delicious and fit this dish perfectly. Everything really came together. I'm not a huge shrimp person, but it was pretty good for shrimp. The women's bathroom was a bit gross and needed attention. However everywhere else seemed pretty well maintained. Overall a very positive experience and delicious food! The cool dinosaur segments were awesome as well! The theming was very neat and perfect for all ages."", 'Long wait but you get seated a few minutes before the estimated time. My only problem was one drink. We ordered a lemonade margarita and it had no patron. The waiter said they premix the tequila but I think they forgot this batch. I basically paid $16 for lemonade. Other drinks were fine. The service was great. I wish they offered us another drink though.My son ordered the nachos. It was huge! Everyone was picking off his plate. He still had leftovers.Burger was too big for a 13 year old. Huge portions. I got the T -bone steak and it was cooked just right. Side mash was creamy. Again big portion.My wife ordered the meat loaf. It was the size of a football. She ate it for 3 days.It was worth the wait. The dinosaurs do a dance every few minutes. Bathrooms were clean. Food portions were huge. Beer selection was great.', ""Four stars for what this is and I would highly recommend coming here over rainforest café which absolutely sucked. This gives you the same atmosphere With moving dinosaurs, meteor showers every 15 minutes or so were the lights dim in the ice cave turns different colors, much friendlier stuff, much quicker service And the food was overall much better and they had a better menu selection. \xa0Not a gourmet meal mind you but for what it is I think it's the coolest option for kids in Disney springs.""]",negative
"['Pros: It\'s in a plaza, so there\'s plenty of parking. The menu has all the bangers on it. Drinks were good. However, if you don\'t like sweet alcohol drinks; you may wanna stay clear of the Sneaky GA Peach. I was a fan, but my sister & bestie wasn\'t. The fried deviled eggs & green tomatoes was delicious! We kept commenting on em like, ""they did sumn special to these"" lol Everybody was content with their meal of choice too. Cons: Corn bread was stiff like it was a day old. Our server was knowledgeable & accommodating, but flighty. Meaning, we had to catch \'em when we could to ask for things or order cus we ain\'t know when he was gonna come back. Otherwise, I definitely recommend it. I heard great things about this location & it lived up to the hype!', 'Upon being seat the waitress promptly asked us if we wanted a drink. My date said water with lemon and I asked for sweet tea and \xa0she gave me a bunch of sweet tea flavored options and upon hearing the options I said no I will have water with lemon also. But she still brought out tea with two waters. I said excuse me and she turn rolled her eyes at me. After telling my date ""she just rolled her eyes at me, hearing she stopped to see what I needed. I explained that I didn\'t want the tea and rather than argue with her I said fine leave it. The tea taste like pure sugar. On top of that my glass of water had a black floater see photo. With the attitude, poor service and a floater in my glass , I was over it. I will say that that lady at the front desk was Amazing. Did her job professionally... Spot on.. \xa0Best of luck!!!', 'We came in because family from out of town wanted to check out the scene and have a good meal. Walked in to secure our spot the lady taking the party\'s name said that they\'re would be 30 minute wait. Cool no problem we had a lot of conversation sat in the front area chatting, 30 plus minutes passed and a guy comes out and says we can\'t sit inside so we got up checked to see how much longer he said that there will be another 30 minutes and that there two party\'s ahead of us. We then went outside. We waited over an hour. When we finally got seated we realized it wasn\'t because they are packed it was because they are slow and the waitress was loopy in the head. Forgetting things here and there. No napkins no refills on our drinks incorrect orders she said the menu was wrong and not updated. Also Inside we were seated in separate tables bcuz we had to many people. The person who seated us said we couldn\'t move the tables (they were movable and the same waitress was serving us paying with one check) so great that makes a lot of since. The waitress was not very enthused and not personable at all. It was like she was a robot. We asked questions about the menus same dull ""Oh it\'s great"" .....like it was rehearsed. On a another note the trash in the bathroom was over flowing and the water on the floor was never addressed just walked over numerous times. We waited a while for our food. The waitress came out stating it was coming they make everything fresh which it\'s great. However I\'m not sure why if it was made fresh out food was cold.', 'Everything was tasty the service was great shout out to Olivia for being bomb!!! \xa0And the cornbread my tastebuds are in love!!!!', ""So excited to come here they were on a wait , when they called me and told me I have 10min to arrive , I did and then stood there with no greeting , we called to one of the guys work there then we were sat only to get the bare service waited 20min for drinks which I must say the peach \xa0Long Island iced tea was amazing however sadly I can't tell you how the food is since after waiting one hour for food and watching people get their food before us we left smh \u200d"", ""In ATL over night for a drive the AL. Decided to make a stop the OLG restaurant - Camp Creek location. Soon as I walked in the door, it was a \xa0great experience. \xa0I was greeted and seated with a smile at the bar - my preference. Bartender Ms. KeKe is the bombay l, and had a great attitude and mix the drinks well. \xa0KeKe was very professional and knew her drinks and the entire menu. All my food choices were outstanding - salmon bites, fried wings, yams, greens, blk eyed peas and yesss babe the Mac n cheese delicious ciousssss. I will be back and the only accuse to visit \xa0AtL lol . \xa0Todd/Kandi have a gem - beautiful atmosphere, I can't take good pix, my pix don't reflect the quality of food at OLG and the overall service delivery at OLG . Superb blk owned operated business"", ""Worst service ever! I am giving any stars because the food was actually pretty good. I was really excited to try this place out, I heard it had good food and as I love kandi buress I had to stop. Capable of entering after a security guard let us in. Was surprised that there was no wait to sit which was nice. First thing we noticed - loud ass music! Not only that, whoever DJs literally won't let a song play completely before abruptly stopping and changing the song.We sat for at least 20 minutes before our server showed up to take our orders, considering the wait we already knew what we wanted to drink and eat so we ordered it all at that time. I ordered a salad with ranch dressing. It was really good. My son ordered the fried chicken meal with Mac and cheese and French fries - he enjoyed it all. My fiancé wasn't hungry so he ordered a coke. Server didn't notice we didn't have silverware until she delivered the food. At this time it took an additional five minutes before we can eat. She hands us a napkin wrapped fork, no other utensils. I asked for salt and pepper, which took an additional 10 minutes. The server didn't return to fill our drinks up or ask how anything was. We didn't see her until we received the check. I am normally a really good tipper but based on this interaction I planned to give less than my norm, well guess what, can't do that as they automatically add 18% to the check. I've never had any restaurant add gratuity automatically for a party of three. \xa0I paid my bill and never plan to return."", 'I ordered the fried chicken and paid $7 extra for all white meat which made the fried chicken $27. I received a breast and two wings, so I guess I paid $7 for two wings....ok. After I gave the server my credit card, she added a lemonade to my check that she previously forgot to add, that\'s cool, but she should\'ve told me. My coworker asked for water to go, and the server said, ""We only give plastic cups to children""...ok. Speaking of children, they do not have a kid\'s menu. Let\'s talk about the taste of the food. The mac n cheese was dry. The fried chicken was good, but for $27, it better be. The peach lemonade was good, but I didn\'t taste peach, just a lot of sugar. The restaurant score is a B(89), and it\'s not a good experience. It feels like someone who is very frugal owns the restaurant. I have never been told that I can\'t get water to-go by any other restaurant.', ""My 45 minute wait tuned into a 2 hour wait. \xa0I hour in they said I was next, then seated two people that just walked in into my seat. \xa0I tried to patient realizing they were short staffed, but that is not an excuse for ignoring the front entry for more than 20 minutes at a time multiple times with no communication.By the time my party of two was seated the restaurant was predominantly empty and the music had started which was uncomfortably loud. \xa0The worse part is the manager was the person who walked off, said she'd be right back and never returned. \xa0Maybe they have so many customers that \xa0they no longer have value for them."", ""I have been so excited to get this place during one of my visits to Atlanta. I walked in and was immediately greeted. It was early and they were not busy. There were 8 servers standing around at the bar and A server did not come to the table for 10 minutes. She was so kind and sweet. She told me she was new but could make some recommendations. She recommended the deviled eggs and she was right, delicious. That's the only thing that gets an excellent rating. I ordered the Fried Chicken with Mac n cheese and sweet potato suffle. When it came out it was 3 wings drenched in barbecue sauce and they were cold. When I asked the server she said they were all out of fried chicken and this was the only chicken they had. The Mac n cheese tastes really good. The sweet potatoes were just mixed with some brown sugar. The sides look they are baked in huge holiday serving pans and just scooped out and rewarded in the dish. I was so disappointed with the $49 overpriced meal. I really wanted to love this place. The floor was very slick and greasy. They had down a few runners.""]",negative
"[""These cupcakes are so good! They're a specialty store so they are expensive, but I only get one on special occasions. There's a cupcake vending machine outside. I think it's unique to this store and only a couple of others around the states. You'll pay more for a cupcake if you use the machine vs going inside, but the cool thing is that you can order from the vending machine after store hours. I've never craved a cupcake badly enough to use it but it's cool anyway.They have gluten free Red Velvet cupcakes and they are delicious! I think they have other gluten free flavors on rotation. Honestly everything I've had here is great! They also have ice cream if you're not a cake person."", 'Sprinkles are definitely for Winners! \xa0SOLD!....Look no further!!Three words: ""Red Velvet Cupcake!"" Don\'t be distracted by all the other options and there are many to choose from. \xa0Go directly to the register, do not look at the other flavors, order a dozen red velvet cupcakes, and pretend you\'re only going to eat one ""for now"" but watch......the whole dozen will be crushed within the hour! \xa0This was definitely the case during my last visit to the ATL last weekend. \xa0I am currently in the gym paying my debts and booked a session with my personal trainer....to feel better about the glutton experience....Thanks Sprinkles! \xa0LOL!Okay....I must say that there is a ""WOW"" factor about these cupcakes. \xa0I, in particular, was over the cupcake craze but thanks to Sprinkles...my interest has been reborn!I enjoyed six (6) decadent Red Velvet cupcakes, an awesome Capt-in Crunch Peanut Butter Chocolate, White Chocolate, Sprinkles Original, Banana Darck chocolate & Strawberry cupcake from this place to the point that I was quite disappointed when it was all gone. My fault though...because at the a cost of approx. $3.66/a cake....or $22 bucks for 6; I only bought a half-dozen and killed them all in a hour! LOLAll the cupcakes came with a generous layer of frosting and a soft-well balanced cake that somewhat melts in your mouth. \xa0My absolute favorite was the Red Velvet! \xa0It was not too sweet and had that ""good ol\' southern bite and twang"" of buttermilk and chocolate flavor....only my Grandma can execute. \xa0The cupcake\'s texture was moist and each bite had me craving for more! \xa0The second for me was the banana dark chocolate. \xa0It was heavenly filled with a mixture of banana-bread like cake and dark chocolate flavor. Again, I could not get over how moist the cupcake was and it was so good indeed. If you are a chocolate lover, like me, you must add this one and the white chocolate cupcake on your wish list of try\'s. \xa0One thing I must say, in which you can take for good or bad is that Sprinkles is very generous on the icing tip. \xa0I, myself, am not a big icing fan and am more about the cake. \xa0So for me, the icing on all the cupcakes were bit too much for my fancy. \xa0But no biggie, just scrape half of that bad boy off! \xa0Also, the signature dots (sprinkle candy) adorning the cupcake\'s crown is something I didn\'t like. LOL...I know wierd...but I must say it. \xa0It\'s too crunchy and taste like bland paste in comparison to the rest of the cupcake & icing profile. \xa0I actually thought I chipped a tooth eating it. \xa0At any rate, don\'t let my rant on ""Things Don Distaste on Cupcakes"" fool ya. \xa0Sprinkles cupcakes are legit-- a decadent joy to eat! In all, a solid cupcake and excellent customer service. \xa0I give Sprinkles 4.5 Stars! \xa0A 1/2 star deduction for the over-geneous icing and the chalky ""Valentine"" candy-like finish on some of the cupcakes.* Honorable Mention(s):I was not aware of this.....but they offer ""Bake at Home Kits"" containers as gift items and t-shirts for purchase.', ""They have The Best Cap'n Crunch ice cream. Hands down! It doesn't just have Cap'n Crunch pieces in it, it's also Cap'n Crunch flavored ice cream! Greatness! That paired with the red velvet cupcake is so yummy. Coffee flavored ice cream was pretty good. Nothing special about but sill good. The chocolate chocolate cupcake wasn't anything spectacular either. Yet and still, I ate it all!! And a few bites of my friend's because hers was way better than mine! Lol"", 'Yasssssssssss!When I was in the Lenox Mall and turned the corner to find a Sprinkles Cupcake here I audibly screamed just that.What\'s even cooler about this location is that it\'s one part cupcake shop and one part ice cream shop- sugar overload at it\'s finest. Since I knew I wanted a cupcake, I say, ""sorry"" to the ice cream and went with what I know- their red velvet cupcake.One cupcake will run you $3.75 We ordered two cupcakes, a coffee and a glass of milk and it came to almost $13.The girls at the register were great and had really good customer service skills.The red velvet is also available in gluten free and vegan if necessary- i got the regular version.The icing on the cupcake was so amazing. The perfect blend of sweet without being overbearing. You could taste the cheesecake ever so slightly in the batter and the cupcake itself was definitely made today. Totally fresh. So fresh they had to put the icing on them in the back and brought them to us.The store is small for having two independent stands there as the ice cream and the cupcakes are sold separately. There are a few tables and chairs for you to enjoy your sweet before you leave.Four cupcakes will run you $15 and don\'t think I didn\'t contemplate buying four but I knew I\'d eat them immediately and they wouldn\'t have a chance of making it home.', 'OMFG!!!!!! I had a cupcake from a vending machine. In real life. And it was soft and moist. Omg. It was sooooo damn good. I had a strawberry cupcake. Babi had a red velvet. Mine was bomb of course. Definitely need one of these in Alabama and if we have it I need to be made AWARE!!!!!! Good lord. Heaven victories. 1/27/18Needed dessert after the shopping and tried Mango Sorbet it was delicious.

I moved here from California and was excited when they put one at Lenox! I mean it's about an hour drive for me .... but whyyyyy?!"", ""This place is great! I loved the huge variety of cupcake flavors, ice cream flavors, cookies and brownies that they had. It was just tough picking the one I wanted to try. I ended up getting ice cream in a cup- the peanut butter cup flavor and cap'n crunch flavor. Sooo good! Despite the chilly evening I ate every single bite!The next time I go back I'm looking forward to trying a sprinkles sundae with a cupcake AND ice cream! Also, I can't fail to mention the cupcake atm- such a fun idea!I stayed at a hotel across the street from this mall and it was a quick and fun walk over. Can't wait to visit again!"", ""My friend wanted to drop by to check out the flavors and we settled on cuban coffee! It had coffee frosting with chocolate base and it was so damn good. The frosting was surprisingly not to sweet and the cupcake wasn't too dry. She taught me a novel way to eat cupcakes by flipping the top over and sandwiching the frosting like a sandwich. I've never tried that before, but it was fantastic since every bite of chocolate cupcake had some frosting. I'd highly recommend giving that a try."", ""Sprinkles was pretty tasty. We got a few cupcakes and an ice cream sandwich. The ice cream was nothing to write home about but the cupcake was yummy. A bit dry but the icing wasn't over done and it had great flavor! The cupcake ATM was pretty rad and I've used it when I was in A huge hurry and didn't have a gift for the birthday girl. Honestly it's just outrageously priced for cupcakes. Good on the company, they have to be making serious money. I just can't give 5 stars to Sprinkles. My cupcake should do a backflip for almost $5 each."", ""I don't know what the big deal is about Sprinkles. I think that the cupcake ATM is a pretty neat idea! However, my friend and I decided to go into the establishment and get a good look at the cupcake options. Some of the items listed on the ATM were not available that particularly day - for example, banana (which I was looking forward to trying). When we walked in, we were directed to another area to order the cupcakes. It was kinda confusing cause there was info about the cupcakes where we first entered. Anywho. There was a bit of a line around 1, but not too bad. I like that the cupcakes are lined up in trays right in front of you so that you can get a good look. I opted for strawberry and lemon blueberry (a daily special). I was not a fan of either cupcake. The frosting is dense which is a turnoff for me. I like it nice and fluffy. Also, way too sweet. I had to take most of it off. The strawberry cake was devoid of flavor, in my opinion. The flavor just came from the frosting. The lemon blueberry was a bit better - nice juicy blueberries. A great option for spring and summer. Service was acceptable. However, somehow the orders got messed up and they had the order ready for the lady behind us AFTER my friend. I don't expect to be back. Much better cupcakes to be found in Atlanta.""]",negative
"[""Gourdoughs! I'm so happy I found Gourdoughs. Out of all he places I went in Austin, Gourdoughs may have been my favorite. The dinner is amazing and the dessert is even better. We got the Ron Burgundy, which is one of their famous donut burgers, for dinner. I know you might be afraid of a donut burger, but don't worry the donuts are not overpowering. It is basically just fried dough used as buns. It does not have extra glaze that would make it too sweet. As for dessert, save room. There were 7 of us there, so naturally we got 7 huge donuts. We got the Elvis one, a freebird, a dirty harry, the salty balls (that's the name), funky monkey, black betty and sin-a-bomb. I would say the majority of the group liked Sin-a-bomb and salty balls the best, but mine was definitely the funky monkey. It was basically an amazing bananas foster. Highly highly recommend."", ""Disclaimer ... \xa0if you are on a diet, either forget about it or run! \xa0Now that, that is out of the way, OMG I LOVE this place!You walk in to a kind of patio area, where a tin food truck is parked. \xa0At first you think is just decoration, to make this cute but NO! this is the kitchen.You can see the people cooking once you sit inside the bar where you order your food.There's high-tables, regular tables, full bar, even Beer Towers (which are on sale on Fridays for $19).We ordered one of these and you better be thirsty if you do... \xa0It's A LOT of beer, but we were sharing so it's OK.Once we decided on what beer we directed our attention to the food menu. \xa0Everything is made with donuts. \xa0Donut sandwich, donut burger, donut entrees, donut for dessert. \xa0I'm sure they had some salads but I who goes there for that?!!?It took us a while to decide but finally we narrowed it down to Onion Rings and Fried Pickles to start.Fried Pickles were hot, crunchy outside, delicious dill pickle inside. I'm not a fan of onion rings but these were ones I could eat (and I did) - really good!Obviously I went with a burger. \xa0This one was called Ron Burgundy - burger patty, fried egg, bacon, American cheese, cilantro, guacamole, tomato and, instead of regular mayo, I asked for their Chipotle Mayo. \xa0This burger is huge! \xa0but don't be afraid, the only one biting here is you... \xa0I cut it in half and dug in. \xa0Wow! \xa0All the flavors of all the ingredients come through. \xa0I was getting full but no way I was leaving half of this burger behind. \xa0So, I started taking part of the donut bun off, and kept eating until I couldn't anymore. \xa0Would have liked to finish it but it was just impossible. \xa0Had to sacrifice eating the chips it comes it but, no regrets! \xa0That burger was worth sacrificing that and dessert (yeah, no room for that).Servers were great! \xa0Letting us try beers before we decided on one for our tower, they made recommendations, gave us enough time to decide and then to eat as slow as we needed to eat as much as we could. \xa0Even cheering us on a bit to finish the tower. \xa0Yes, after this meal we swore off fried food for a bit. \xa0We swore we would go on a diet, even said we wouldn't eat again that day (which we did).After all that, we said we would totally do it all over again, given the chance to be back in Austin.Fingers crossed!!"", ""Alas, we can't even comment on the donut quality as it proved impossible to get our hands on one. \xa0After being told it would be nearly an hour wait at the other, donuts-only takeout location, we came here instead hoping for better odds before having to hit the road. We arrived to see very few customers dining inside, so we were hopeful of success. \xa0Then we noticed most of the others who we'd perceived as dine-in patrons were just waiting for to-go orders as well. \xa0And as they started to complain about the wait with zero updates on order status, our hope waned. \xa0After 30+ minutes and interactions with two servers who were unable to provide any update on the timing, we finally had to abandon ship. \xa0Thankfully they were disorganized and had yet to even take our money, so it was easy to do. \xa0Wish we'd been able to sample these impressive-looking delicacies. \xa0And the servers were sympathetic enough, albeit befuddled. \xa0But time is precious and this place just grew utterly frustrating.To be clear - I don't begrudge any establishment their success. \xa0I've been known to wait in a long line for many a latest food craze or a popular stalwart. We just want to know what we're in store for - and be able to plan accordingly. \xa0It was the lack of insight - coupled with perplexing waits due to lack of crowds- that eventually turned us off. \xa0(And we witnessed several others do the same) I think the mini airstream trailer that serves as the kitchen is the culprit. \xa0 Cute, to be sure, but seems to be hindering progress."", ""4.5 stars. I'm donut wasted as I write this review and I hope to live to tell the tale. Gourdough's is an Austin establishment and I finally checked out their downtown location with some friends during my trip to Austin. The interior has that trendy Austin vibe but we're really here to talk about donuts. So many different types of donuts that the menu becomes a bit overwhelming, especially for you indecisive types. They have savory entrees with donuts so we'll start there.I got the country clucker which is a piece of fried chicken on top of a savory donut (not sweet) with creamed corn and candied jalapeños. The donut is a large size and isn't sweet as I was expecting. The chicken, while good, was pretty small. I was expecting a larger portion size but hey that's probably a good thing when you're consuming massive amounts of donuts. Three of my partners in crime got the Ron Burgundy which I feel like you have to get just for the name. It's a donut burger and they all gave two thumbs up. Had I not had Shake Shack earlier that day, I probably would've joined in on the Ron Burgundy action.The thing is, you really can't go to a spot that specializes in donuts without actually having dessert. I split the freebird and the black betty with a friend. Both were incredible. I'm so donut wasted that I can't describe the ingredients in both but trust me, they're good. And I'm not just saying that because I'm donut wasted. Would I be el gordo if I went to Gourdough's on the regular. No doubt. But every once in a while...you've gotta do it."", ""Though I prefer the S Lamar location best, finally checked out the downtown Gourdoughs location. It is kind of oddly set up. You put your food order in at the airstream trailer at the entrance and then you order your drinks at the bar in the back? It is definitely more cramped than the S Lamar location and the late night service, at least on the evening we went, was a bit underwhelming. The food, though, is just as good. The drinks, not so much. It takes a special kind of skill to make an old fashioned as bad as the one I had here, but at least their diet jack w/a lime twist was solid. I don't know that I would make it a point to come back to this location unless in the area and other options are closed. Honestly, I'd probably just make the drive down Lamar."", ""God bless doughnuts. Especially the way that gourdough makes them. You can just taste the soft and warm and just freshly fried skin of the doughnuts, topped with the fresh ingredients that can be berries to bacon or brownie. They are very creative with their doughnut combinations. My all time favorite is the funky monkey which consists of chocolate and banana, everything monkeys love (jks I'm sure they don't have chocolate as we know it readily available to them). We also tried the Nutty Valentine, topped with Nutella and strawberry, the Blackout, chocolate brownie with chocolate chips and drown in chocolate syrup and the Dirty Harry which are donut holes swimming in a bowl of warm hot chocolate topped with coconut shavings. ALL SO FREAKING GOOD. This place is also a bar so drinks are also available, wish they also served warm milk. This place is open all night until 3am so midnight drunkchies! But make sure you try the donuts sober as well, it's just as good."", ""I was so excited to try this place's sit down location after previously having visited the food truck. It was pretty empty on a Monday at lunchtime. My bf and I ordered the Dirty South (the daily special) and donut Dumplings. Since my boyfriend is lactose intolerant, I asked for the Dirty South gravy on the side, but that got overlooked when we received our order. The description of the dumplings on the menu also didn't indicate that they would be swimming in a creamy soup-like substance, which we discovered upon receiving them. I thought they would be donut dumplings stuffed with chicken. In retrospect, the dish was probably the worst thing on the menu. Not a great experience since my bf couldn't eat anything we ordered because of a mess up by the server and poor menu description, but I at least enjoyed the Dirty South."", ""We love coming to Gourdough's after a nice dinner downtown just for their amazing dessert donuts. Most recently we had their Fat Elvis donut that came with grilled bananas, homemade peanut butter icing, crispy bacon and drizzles of honey...and boy was it good. And I don't even like peanut butter icing! Prior too, we tried their Blackout; this is perfect for those with an intense chocolate craving, complete with brownie batter, fudge icing and and topped generously with chocolate-covered brownie bites. They have a make-your-own-donut option as well, for those of a finnicky mind. And just a fair warning; these dessert donuts are definitely as decadent as they sound, so if you're watching that waistline, I would suggest splitting a plate!

We shared the:-Mother Clucker - honey butter drizzled fried chicken over a donut with a side of creamed corn? Heaven. Chicken was soooo flavorful and delicious and the donut is basically fried dough - denser than a regular donut and the flavor combo of donut and chicken is awesome.Creamed corn was warm and yummy as well!- Count Monte Cristo - basically a deep fried monte cristo sandwich, the sweet and salty combination was really good as well.Best meal we had in Austin :)', 'Everything was so delicious!

Cali has In-n'-Out, Washington has Dick's (meh), and then I stumbled upon Little Big Burger while researching for 'fast food' places in Portland.We ordered for delivery via Grub Hub one late Saturday night to our hotel. (FYI - Uber Eats has a lot of extra delivery/service fees so Grub Hub is the better option but if you can, order for pick-up instead, or directly from their site - which I didn't find out that you can until the time of this review). Here is everything we ordered:The Ringer (1/4lb of cascade natural beef, topped with bacon, double Tillamook cheddar, shredded lettuce, caramelized onion & supersauce - served on our baked brioche bun) - you really can't go wrong with bacon and/or caramelized onions. The beef was cooked perfectly.Cheeseburger (1/4lb of cascade natural beef, Tillamook cheese - we chose pepperjack, shredded lettuce, red onion, pickles, camden's catsup, served on our baked brioche bun) - a classicChickenburger (chipotle seasoned chicken thigh custom ground by SP Provisions, Tillamook Cheddar, leaf lettuce, pickle, red onion, and our tangy chick-sauce) - I didn't love this but it's also because I failed to read and thought it would be a fried chicken sandwich. But this is not a bad healthier alternative if you don't want a beef burgerTruffle fries - need I say more? You get a HUGE portion for $4. We were struggling to finish it but then again we did also order three burgers to share between two people. I wouldn't say this is the best burger or fries I've ever had - so why the five stars? It's hard to order burger and fries for delivery and still have it be good. Usually, something gets compromised - typically the juice from the patty makes the bun soggy, or the steam from the fries make those soggy too. But everything tasted great when it arrived (maybe 20-30 minutes after we ordered?) But more importantly, the fries were still crispy (also not oily). How...??? I'm not sure what kind of voodoo they did but I ain't mad at it.Somebody bring Little Big Burger to NYC please!"", ""I certainly expected more, based on some raving reviews. The burger was fine, just fine, really. For me, I know a burger isn't anything special when the bun is my favorite part.

"[""I will start by saying I have only ever attended their brunch so keep that in mind while reading my review. St. Philip is a prime spot for brunching with a group of your closest ladies. It is very trendy and had food that is just made for sharing! I went this morning for brunch with my boyfriend and had a totally different experience than the past few times I have been with a group of girls. I mainly blame the sig other for not wanting to share things with me, boo him! I strongly suggest you take a few friends that are down to share plates and just go to town, order a pizza order either the chicken and funnel cake or french toast. Also try all the sides! The sizes much of their food is more than good for sharing. Things like the grinder and hash I'm not sure I would suggest as a sharing plate but everything else is! The food is great, it is pricey but split among a few people is doable. I have so much left on the menu I still want to try but the tried and trues are just so good that I'm scared to give those up! The atmosphere is nice, not too upscale but still appropriately sophisticated, not the type of place you roll into hungover and looking like a train wreck from last night!The staff is also very attentive and I have always been well taken care of. Overall worth the trip every blue moon to splurge on a nicer brunch!"", 'My husband and were in the area one evening, hungry, and I had St. Philip bookmarked on Yelp as a place to try. So...First impression - walking through the parking lot through towards the entrance saw an armed security guard (or off duty officer) escorting a female employee to the trash receptacle that was literally yards away from the building. Hmm...Having lived in Austin for only about a year and half I\'m not familiar with all of the ""neighborhoods"" - is safety such a concern in Sunset Valley? I going on shopping sprees in the area sometimes and it always seemed fine. ??The building itself is a beautiful mix of modern streamlined design highlighted with light colored wood throughout. Very Zen. There are ample outdoor dining tables and a lovely sitting area in case you simply want to have drinks, or perhaps if there\'s a wait. The dining room is medium sized, with tables tightly packed together, and a bar on one side against the wall. No bells and whistles per se - just nice. The menu has several other options (e.g., salads, sandwiches, a hand full of assorted entrées), but we chose to give the Artisanal pizza a try at the ""Parlor."" Based on the price we decided they must be more like personal pies, so we decided to order 2 (that were recommended as the most popular) and share: Fennel Sausage: Sausage, lots of thinly sliced red onion, Piquillo peppers, basil, and mozzarella on a red sauce. Wild Mushroom: Ricotta, arugula and baby kale on a light umami sauce. You can top any pizza with lightly dressed greens for $2. RIGHT after I ordered I thought ""That would be a nice addition to the lighter side Mushroom pizza-dang!"" I guess the chefs agree, as the Wild Mushroom comes with the mixed greens on top - even though it doesn\'t state so on the menu. Both pizzas were tasty, but not certainly not the best I\'ve ever had. The crust was A-OK, but unfortunately not my favorite style. Just seemed to fall flat a bit (no pun intended); flavorless, slightly crispy, a little chewy. Super fresh toppings. Not overly heavy. NOTE: One pizza is plenty for two, especially if you also shared a salad. Turns out the fancy pies are all one size - 11 inches - which is about 8 slices. The hubby and I literally had an entire pizza left over (half of each; and we didn\'t order any other food) - leftovers! I found the price tag of 10 to 15 bucks per pie, with seasonal ingredients, to be quite reasonable - given that they feed two peeps! I\'d say that\'s cheap eats. \xa0 ST.PPP+B forces you to exit through the bakery at the back side of the building. Perused a couple of the goods and nothing stood out that I just had to have. Overall: When in the area again, I would consider going back for more pizza and perhaps a beer or two. And, I might just have to try the Mussels (I\'m a sucker for them there mollusks) and definitely give the Root Beer and Sassafras Ribs a go. I dunno. Usually when a restaurant has ""Pizza"" in its name, it seems to be what they do best - even if was opened by the same folks as Uchi. Hey, I wouldn\'t order pizza there - even if it was on the menu. Just sayin...', 'I recently went here with a small group of co-workers for a birthday office outing. \xa0There was a group of 6 of us and we were planning to arrive between 4:30-4:45pm. \xa0I called ahead about an hour before and advised them that we would be coming in and asked if we should let them know. \xa0I was told over the phone - oh no problem we will seat you when you get here. \xa0I thought cool.A couple of my co-workers got there 15 minutes early or so. \xa0They were told that they could not be seated until everyone was there. \xa0I understand this policy and have heard it at other places. \xa0The thing is that it was 4:20 or so and the restaurant was practically empty. \xa0There were a few people at the bar and that was it, maybe one table. \xa0I could totally understand this policy if the place was hoppin, but it was not. \xa0So as soon as I got to the restaurant with my other co-workers the 2 that had arrived earlier were a little disgruntled they could not go ahead and head to our table since the place was empty. \xa0I also think that when I called they could have offered to take a reservation for us and that did not happen. \xa0Anyway - we all arrived and got sat at a very nice booth in the corner. \xa0Our waitress, I can not remember her name but she was awesome and bubbly. \xa0She gave us plenty of time to decide on what we wanted and I even grilled her with the menu and what she suggested. \xa0One of my other co-workers had questions about spiciness of certain things and what was in what and she handled all these questions well. \xa0I ordered the B.E.L.T sandwich. \xa0It was pretty good. \xa0Basically it is a BLT with and fried runny egg on it. \xa0It was messy, but good. \xa0When the plate first came to my table to thought the bread was going to hurt the ruff of my mouth because it was so toasted, but it was actually kind of soft but toasted at the same time and very pleasant. \xa0My co-workers ordered a couple of sandwiches and a few pizzas. \xa0The chips that come with the sandwiches were fresh and homemade - they were perfect. \xa0I tasted of the pepperoni pizza and it was decent as well. \xa0Not the best pizza I have ever had but good. \xa0There was a lot of sauce on the pizza it what I kept hearing from my co-workers. \xa0Overall our meal was good, but nothing overwhelming in my opinion and I surveyed my co-workers and they felt very similar to me. \xa0I do feel like our waitress did an awesome job and provided great service which in my book made up for some of the other stuff. On the way out we stopped in the bakery... of course I had to have dessert. \xa0I ended up ordering a slice of the banana pudding cake, twix bar and lemon crumb bar. \xa0OMG - the banana pudding cake was amazing and definitely the best thing at the restaurant! \xa0I love it so much. \xa0I ate that first and then the others and well nothing compared to that cake. \xa0So if you go here - get the banana pudding cake! \xa0I do want to go back and give this place another try. \xa0Next time I will do the small plate menu and have some cocktails and maybe sit at the bar in front of the kitchen. \xa0I feel like that will be a very different experience from this one.', ""The official (non-soft) opening was on Thursday, October 4th. So of course I just had to stop by on Friday, October 5th. At 4:00, there were about five families eating dinner and it was quiet and sweet. About four of us were milling around in the bakery to get something to go, in my case I was picking up dessert for husband's bday dinner. Here's what I tried from the pastry place:Chess Pie: you get a tiny amount for $3 (like one third of a typical slice) but it sure was scrumptiousAmazing Vietnamese Coffee Pastry: can't remember the official name but I love coffee and this dessert was the bomb. Salt & Caramel Choux Puff: little pouf of pastry sort of like an eclair. It was pretty good. Lemon Meringue Pie: It was really egg-y and delicious, but it sort of fell apart into three separate sections on the plateCan you tell I used to be the pastry reviewer for Bon Appetit?

Got quite a few things and weren't really impressed by any of them. Meat balls with the Parmesan sauce were good. You get 4 of them and they have good flavor, but nothing really stood out about them as special. The cauliflower was probably the best, most unique thing we ordered. Again, good flavor, but I can make better at home. The Mac n cheese was good, but more like Alfredo. The ham in it gave it a nice twist and the bread crumbs topped it well. We built a pizza with pepperoni and sausage. It reminded me of California Pizza Kitchen, which is definitely not a bad thing. But it just doesn't deserve the hype it's been getting. Finally we ordered the toffee buzz brownie. It was definitely not worth the calories or the cash. I have heard the happy hour is pretty great. So I'll probably come back sometime soon to check it out. If it's any better I'll add a star. Haha"", 'This weekend I finally made it out to St Philip and was impressed with the decor, food and wine selection. We dined in during brunch on a Sunday and a short wait.We started off with a glass of wine on tap. The Rosé on tap I ordered was great and I had a taste of the red on tap (good deal at $7, $5 during happy hour) was also a solid wine. I opted for a small plate of golden cauliflower which made for a perfect light meal. Whoever came up with this delightful mixture of tender cauliflower,herbed yogurt, Marcona almond & slightly sweet golden raisins is pure genius. My dining partner ordered the brisket hash with crispy potatoes, sofrito, cheese curds topped with a fried egg and it looked phenomenal. The one small improvement I would like to see is the A/C working better. It was pretty warm inside the restaurant. I look forward to coming back for happy hour and enjoy $5 wines on tap $4 bites.', ""What a difference one and a half years has made with this restaurant. I had complained about running our of many of the entrees on the menu but now it's a moot point since they don't offer these anymore (?). Now St. Phillip is a full blown Pizza place and place and somewhere to drink craft beers.One main crust (I think gluten free is available) and about 10 different styles. I would have expected more choices in the kind of crust especially in a crowed town of pizza joints. No sandwiches, spaghetti or other options, just pizza and appetizers. All in all you can better spend your money and get more variety elsewhere."", 'Been here on multiple occasions for lunch with coworkers. Less than polite hostesses were reluctant to seat us missing 2 people but did anyway saying ""Just so you know for next time, we don\'t seat incomplete parties."" Uh okay. Why are you seating us then?Besides rude service from the hostess, we were saddened to find a much shorter menu that basically got rid of all the menu items that weren\'t pizza. No meatballs. No steak sando. It was disappointing to say the least.I like the food and I\'ve had good service in the bakeshop, but recent attitude from the hostesses and a big change in the menu means a drop in my star rating.', ""I'm so glad I got to go to St. Philip before leaving the ATX. It was one of the most enjoyable restaurant experiences I've had in a long time. I came in for happy hour for a friend's birthday around 4. They were very accommodating to our large group and people arriving at different times. Service was phenomenal! Jonah was our server and took such great care of us. We ordered two of everything on the happy hour menu - house made potato chips, polenta fries, meatball sliders, pepperoni pull apart bread (think monkey bread but stuffed with cheese and pepperoni!), and the daily pizza option which was burrata, tomato and basil. I also enjoyed a local glass of Trebbiano on happy hour pricing. For entrees, we let Jonah take the reins. We simply asked him to pick a handful of dishes that would be good for sharing. He knocked it out of the park with a couple orders of cauliflower in yogurt sauce, ricotta mint dumplings, a pork shank, roasted carrot + avocado salad, and house meatballs. Us girls also split a couple of Caesar salads. Towards the end of the meal Jonah brought out not one but two complimentary desserts for the birthday girl. Such a nice touch! Everyone left stuffed and satisfied for around $30/person (before tip). I would highly recommend St. Philip and am pretty confused by the less than stellar reviews. They've got it goin on."", ""Ok, so St. Philip is one of those restaurants that I wish I could give 3.5 stars. I've been here twice and both times the food was sort of bland. With that being said, the atmosphere is great, the service is decent, and the baked goods are yummy. Also, they have really reasonable beer prices. During this visit, we went on a Sunday right at the end of brunch. We actually ended up taking so long to order that they were no longer serving brunch by the time we finally got it together. Not a big deal, as I'd had their brunch before and everybody else at the table was ordering pizza anyway. I ordered the house meatballs with Parmesan brodo, which was a type of cream sauce. They were good, but just lacking in flavor a little. Last time I visited St. Philip, I had the biscuits & gravy, which they didn't have on the menu this time. It too was kind of bland. Boyfriend ordered the NYC pizza, which was basically a pepperoni pizza. It was ok, but again, a little bland (are you seeing a trend here?). I feel like if there was such a thing as a flavor dial, I could just turn it up and this place would be awesome. Now for the desserts. St. Philip has a small bake shop as an extension to the restaurant, so you can order items from next door and they'll be delivered to your table, or you can order off of their dessert menu. I ordered a homemade hazelnut twix bar from their bakery. It was delicious. It had a hint of a coffee flavor too. Boyfriend ordered a coconut cookie, which was fine, just not my thing. Last time we visited, we had one of their homemade chocolate whoopie pies and it was tasty too. All in all, I would totally go back and sit at the bar and have some desserts.""]",positive

Fish was really well cooked tho, pretty smooth. Gotta eat the sauce with the fish in the same bite Steak: it was pretty good but still can't compare to dried aged steak from a steak house Guava dessert: it was an interesting dessert, kinda like guava iceZepolle: my favorite dessert, really fresh and warm donut balls with some kind of caramel dip on the side"", ""I tried Juniper for the first time when visiting Austin... It was very difficult to get a reservation since they are usually booked out for the weekend but I managed to get a reservation for 10 pm. However, when I arrived they still made me wait an extra 30-45 minutes PAST my reservation time... I was getting very hungry and the closing time was 11 pm which is disappointing. If not for the disappointing service, the food itself would deserve 4.5 stars although a bit pricey. As of February 2022, the menu is pretty misleading since it mentions a $75 Prix Fixe menu (all u can eat for fixed price of $75). However, as of now they haven't implemented this fixed price policy yet and still charge for every dish you order. The appetizer was a very large pieces of bread with an unexpected sweet \xa0taste + olive oil. For main dishes, we ordered the cacio e pepe and goat chevre cappelletti. The cacio e pepe pasta was extremely cheesy and flavored very well - although overpriced in my opinion. The capelletti also tasted amazing, especially the fresh goat cheese but portion sizes were in the smaller side. Finally we got the guava granita, which had a very fluffy texture kinda like a fancy shaved ice. I didn't like the flavor very much since it wasn't that sweet and tasted a bit artificial, although perhaps I just don't like guava flavor as much as other fruits.If it's your anniversary, you will get 2 glasses of pinot grigio on the house!"", ""- I came here for the tasting course menu (9 courses $125).I recommend the center cut ribeye, beautiful color, texture, and seasoning. - I don't recommend the Poach Halibut or Hiramasa Crudo.

I dont mind smaller portion in overall but not such ratio gap between ingredients (pictures below).- Dessert: it's kind of heavy for me. I was hoping something more delicate but the orange pudding inside the tart is refreshing and new.- Great Customer service--- In overall, the tasting course menu is worth to try but I would expect an improvement for the next visit."", 'The service and atmosphere at Juniper is beautiful. We sat outside and got to enjoy the gorgeous weather last night. My husband and I each had the chefs taste seasonal menu with wine pairings and unfortunately the flavors really missed the mark for us both. We found each dish either just okay or not very tasty. Flavor combinations were not great overall and nothing special at all. I think we might have been happier with choosing something off the regular menu. For a $500 dinner bill, we were pretty dissatisfied and will not return. And I cant say I recommend this restaurant to anyone unfortunately.', ""I have been to Juniper for dinner before. This time, a friend and I decided to check out their brunch. They had a prefix menu ($45) and an a la carte menu; both menus had the same items and just different pricing. We got an Aperol Spritz and Tequila Sunrise to start, along with the beef carpaccio. Their beef carpaccio is amazing - I highly recommend trying it out. My friend got the eggs benedict for her meal, and I got the rollatini. Both were perfect. My friend enjoyed her eggs benedict so much that she was drinking the hollandaise like a bowl of soup. We really enjoyed our meal there, and the service was phenomenal. If you've been there for dinner and liked your experience, I definitely recommend making a reservation and trying out the brunch."", ""My husband chose Juniper for us during our quick trip in Austin to celebrate a special occasion. The food did not disappoint; however, the service and the way the staff treats special occasions did. We ordered all our courses from the prix fixe menu. What really stood to us was the gnocchi sardi pasta. My husband's words on this dish: This dish exhibited a depth of taste that was unparalleled to any other pasta dish I have ever had. My sincerest compliments to the chef for their ability to harmoniously layer three separate flavors into what many would scoff at as a benign gnocchi dish. First, you taste a subdued sweetness that quickly transitions into a palatable acidity as you begin to chew the perfectly cooked pasta that has been saturated in a well developed sauce. Then, as if presented with a long forgotten relic, you get walloped with the finishing sting of spice that closes out each bite. By outward appearance this dish might belie itself as any other plate of pasta. If you are risk averse than I recommend you stick with the amateurs; this is a dish for the bold and fearless. While my description sounds absurd to the point of pretentiousness, I cannot overstate how genuinely unique and pleasing this dish was. Not just in regards to the depth of flavor but also because I had to think about what was going on after each spoonful. Never in my life have I paused repeatedly to contemplate how a plate of food could evoke my three primary senses in such a pronounced way that I would take the time to write this, possibly, incoherent review. A review that can never fully serve as a suitable substitute for actually eating the dish. Needless to say it took me a while to finish it and I would go back just for this dish. Back to the service. We have been to many restaurants that make special occasions memorable whether it be a complimentary glass of champagne, desert with a written congratulations, or even just a SPOKEN congratulations. The hostess was the only person that seemed happy to say congrats. Our server almost seemed forced to say anything and he mentioned that he had only been there a month, which might explain his lack of social awareness... I am not sure what happened there. However, the manager did come around and although he initially seemed completely clueless too that we were celebrating anything, he went the extra mile by the end of the night. \xa0We are grateful that he made sure we left satisfied. He was very professional and exhibited the competency that at times some of the younger staff lacked unfortunately. However, because of the overall lack in service and attentiveness from the staff from the beginning and throughout the night, we will more than likely not return (unless my husband insists on going back for the unforgettable pasta dish)."", ""Good food. Nice atmosphere. Worth trying. The interior looks like it came straight from a design store or art museum. Cool!The service was good and the staff is clearly knowledgeable about the food they serve (where it's sourced, ingredients, flavors, etc).Food came out very quickly, to my surprise. Focaccia 5/5- perfect for two to share- crunchy and warm and tasty- ricotta was light and creamy with a hint of lemonCacio e Pepe 5/5- delectable, creamy, rich, dense, and simply wonderful- tasted great without the $25 add on truffleSalmon Crudo 4/5- salmon tasted fresh and tender- gelee was a questionable addition to the dish... not a fanRisotto 4/5- texture was spot on- flavor was good but a bit too tangy"", ""This is my second time I've been to Juniper. The last time I was here was two years ago, and the only question I can ask myself is why didn't I come sooner. This was by far one of the best meals I've had in Austin in a while and the service was terrific. We had the sweetest waitress who had just moved here from Australia and she made sure my boyfriends birthday was made a very special. On the menus they said happy birthday and then at the end they sent him home with a gift box full of goodies and everyone of the chefs signed the menu for him.

"[""Our first buffet trip in what felt like ages. Koy Wan is the best buffet around with good reason: they have the best variety and tastiest food for the money.

Gloves and masks required when away from the table. Nothing but paper plates and plastic cups used for drinks. Plus plenty of sanitizing options available plus space between tables. I don't often get hungry for buffets nowadays, but if I do; it's definitely Koy Wan for me. For just my son and myself, the total bill was slightly under $37. It's certainly not the cheapest, but you will NOT leave without being full."", 'This use to be our dinner go-to for my spouse and I and two friends every other Saturday. It is $15.99 all day dinner on Saturday so we went for a late lunch about 1pm. \xa0The sushi is the best of this place.They have tuna, salmon, octopus, white fish are all on the raw bar. The variety of all the other sushi rolls are just too many to list, so delicious each and every one of them and are fresh, too.They have a hibachi grill that has many choices to create a plate, however the two people at our table had the hibachi grill and both plates were overcooked although they did taste good, the meats were dry and tough to eat. The selection of the hot bar area use to always have hot food. Some items were not even warm. I had to ask for and wait a few minutes for the oysters, that pan was empty.The blue crabs were good and many of the entrees are seasoned and tasted pretty good...excluding the, less than warm, items. I was lucky enough to get a few warm crab rangoon and they were delicious. The selection of fruit use to be greater than the 4 pans that were there. The cake, cookies and puffs are sub-standard. We are likely to be back, but not too soon.', 'Koy Wan has long been a favorite haunt - but no more. While it has been slowly declining over the last couple of years, today was the last straw.They insisted that we customers wear face masks and gloves at the buffet, yet the grill chef and the employee refilling food pans were wearing neither masks nor gloves. I\'m not into masks to begin with - but don\'t make the customers wear them if the employees are not doing so.The tables did not appear to have been cleaned since the previous guests. When I pointed out to our waitress that the table still had drink and food spills, she moved us to another one - which was actually worse than the first one. Even the napkin dispenser was filthy with greasy finger prints bits of food. Glue residue from the little ""don\'t waste food"" notes they tape on the table tops was also trapping food crumbs, and who knows what else. I asked for a wet cloth with which to clean the table, but she just stood there arguing about the tape, so I finally wiped it down with a napkin. The COVID protocols certainly do not make sense if you are not going to bother cleaning the dining room. And I would much prefer a clean table & chairs.The food was nowhere near as good as it has been all these years.

Sushi is decent, so I'll leave that alone. The rest of the buffet is not very good. The items were mostly tasteless. Even the egg rolls tasted like they came from an inferior vendor.

Building reminds me of something that when originally built was very nice, but has changed hands so many times over the years it is just way past its prime."", ""Only giving this one star because I don't think I can give them zero. Paper plates and plastic silverware. I get trying to be safe, but at least spring for the paper plates that aren't going to fail before I sit down. The restaurant barely had AC.

You do have a lot to choose from, but my favorite items like ribs and wings and Mei Fun were cold and old.My wife had the Hibachi grill. She told me her noodles tasted burnt like the grill had not been cleaned. She did not even finish her plate.My wife and I have been to different Asian buffets and this one needs help... keep the food hot and fresh no matter what time it is.

I've been deployed and had better food than this. All the silverware and plates are all plastic and paper so you will struggle to build your plate without it falling and the cups are paper so picking up your cup is a risk in itself.

It sadly resembled a small neighborhood grocery store packaged sushi and was not nearly as nice as what Publix now serves to go from the Sushi department. My favorite dishes were all completely changed and the flavor totaly less appetizing. My husband noticed that most of the kitchen help and cooks are Mexican and not sian.

"[""I've lived in Somerville for over 4 years and since year 1 when I first tried Sam's this is the only Mediterranean I would ever consider ordering. Nothing in the area comes close.

No one is perfect and I might have jumped to reviewing your establishment under anger. Makes sense about the restroom situation and I completely understand now. After visiting your restaurant again yesterday, I can't say enough great things about you and the business. I truly appreciate you welcoming me the way you did. The food was absolutely amazing! Keep up the great work and I look forward to visiting again."", 'I\'ve lived in Somerville for 8yrs and I honestly regret not going to Sam\'s Falafel sooner. In the last year or so, I\'ve come here for the majority of my falafel cravings and it always hits the spot. You get a lot of bang for your buck, the food is tasty as heck, and the owner is incredibly friendly (he even remembered that I recently got engaged, and asked about the wedding. Surprising level of customer service for a quick serve establishment where they are pushing orders!). My fiancé (look, I can say that now!) usually gets the chicken shawarma or the Sams special (it\'s huge. Like two sizes bigger than the regular sandwich lol), and I\'ll order a falafel + chicken shawarma. I don\'t think that\'s actually on the menu but he\'s pretty nice about letting me get the best of both worlds :) I have been meaning to try the eggplant sandwich, but it\'s hard to stray from that tasty, crunchy, perfectly seasoned falafel. Which - usually if you wait long enough (5-15min), you\'ll be handed a hot, crunchy falafel to ease your wait time. I honestly have no problems with going there, ordering, and waiting. It hardly ever takes more than 15mins, and there\'s a tv that plays videos of silent cooking that I find weirdly soothing. If I HAD to choose one downside to Sams (really not enough to knock a star off), it\'s that prior to my first visit, I wasn\'t sure if this place was a work of fiction or not because every time we came, it was closed. I\'m glad I was persistent though, because every time since they have been open and serving up tasty food! Would definitely recommend trying if you\'re in the area!Adding a small edit: I haven\'t been to Sam\'s prior to the pandemic, but I\'m eager to continue being a customer long after covid is ""over with"". That being said, several of these reviews knock a business over things like price, masks/covid protocol, delivery, customer service etc. Just remember that it is hard as heck for restaurant owners these days when it comes to profit/loss, staffing, and business margins, so practice a little patience and be gratuitous with your benefit of the doubt! Thank you for coming to my Ted talk :)', ""So I'm new to the area and glad to see that Sam's Falafel place is quite within walking distance.

So I would sympathize with him when he gets heated about the situation. Personally I'll definitely be ordering directly with them in the future.I had a wait a little bit when I arrived for food pick up but the wait was definitely well worth it. They were quite amazing. One of the most juicy and tasty Lamb Shawarma I've tasted and the Falafel was really tasty and fresh too and not dry.

The clams and mussels were soft and easy to chew the fish seemed to be over laden with spice at first. \xa0The broth had a very seafood and tomato flavor that makes me want to take the rice and have it absorb the broth it just the rice but the bread as well.The Mac and cheese had a smoky flavor. The pasta was cooked Al dente and \xa0you get the cheesy flavor.The Caesar salad had a little too much dressing but very good.Overall a wonderful experience. \xa0One that I would recommend to everyone.', 'Big Fin is a big flop as far as I am concerned.

Hubs selected the highly recommended grilled oysters appetizer and raved on and on. \xa0Additionally Hubs enjoyed Grouper PicattaIn lemon butter sauce, grilled asparagus, minus the vinegary capers in the sauce. \xa0I was stuffed and only had eyes for the delicious lobster Mac. I will return... \xa0you should too! for the lobster Mac. Raymond said this dish is blended with 5 cheeses. While dining this evening Hubs mentioned Big Fin seafood was voted best seafood restaurant over the years. I do agree. I will say Raymond's table service was quality. \xa0Did I mention the lobster Mac and cheese?"", 'For a higher end restaurant, Big Fin falls short on the overall ""experience"" part of what a restaurant like this should deliver. The environment is sterile, loud and difficult to enjoy your dining partners conversation. More likened to a cafeteria type of look and feel. Think high ceilings, white walls and fluorescent lighting and you\'ll get the picture. I booked it for an important client dinner and was disappointed with the atmosphere and the service. The food was good but not great. There are better choices in Orlando for seafood.', 'Magical dining upgraded to Chilean Sea-bass. It came with 2 leaves of bok choy and that was it. Not even a whole bulb. Most places serve this type of dish with jasmine rice so I was surprised to see that this was all you get. The fish was good, but rice would have been great to soak up the broth, and a whole bok choy bulb would have been nice.', ""Finally decided to check out this restaurant and came for their happy hour menu! The food was really good the fish tacos were flavorful. I definitely wanted to check out their oysters it's six for $10 and it did not disappoint! We try one of the sliders it was pretty good decent size for a slider. Although there's nothing much on it other than me and buns but it was all right. The ahi tuna I really liked but it's only three pieces so definitely order more if you're hungry.

My girlfriend and I come by once a week and it NEVER disappoints. The staff is so efficient and food gets served quickly- and correctly. Never once have they messed up our order in over 20 visits!

First time we visited he surprised us with two drinks and they were soooo good. I recommend with no reservation !"", ""I went here for happy hour on a Thursday. It was from 4:30-6pm. The happy hour drink menu is very impressive, no matter what kind of alcohol you like, you'll probably find a drink on there for you. I had a margarita-style drink with mango and it was delicious. My friend and I ordered the sampler even though it wasn't part of the happy hour specials. But it was worth it! You get to try a great selection of their tastiest bites: spring rolls, bao buns and chicken satay. And if you like calamari, I recommend you order that too, it did not disappoint. For dessert we got the mango sticky rice and it was very good. In addition the service was very attentive, fast and friendly. And there was a live band playing that really helped create a good ambiance. Go here for happy hour, you won't be disappointed."", ""We had the most fabulous evening. How often do we find ourselves at a restaurant when we're too lazy for home-cooking? Several times a week? It's another motion we go through, and therefore a burden for the free time we've desperately waited for. We wrap our lips around our usual favorites, plagued by the uniformity of another dull weekday. To consider another point of dining reflection: would it not be incomprehensible, or at least nearly so, to spend 4 1/2 hours in a humble,LOCAL establishment? Yes, the unthinkable. Yet, so authentically true. Never once did we arrive at a feeling of confinement or lack of total relaxation. How? Well, it started with Justin, who was instrumental to the unexpected experience we savored this evening, in addition to the exquisite cuisine offered by 1618. The way Justin described the food not only captured my attention, but actively left me excited for our dishes to arrive. She had specific descriptions prepared for every item on the menu, down to the very ingredients, and she displayed a degree of refinement that I carried with me through every bite and sip. I will return to 1618, and I will hope to have the same chefs (and certainly Justin) at our service again. Such a treasure."", ""While the food and atmosphere is divine, the staff truly takes it to another level with their kind and generous service. Truly felt like I was eating with family. If you think you had a bad experience, think again. You are clearly mistaken. Kelly and Lace will provide a once in a lifetime experience that you will never forget. Pho will never be the same again. Dining at 1618 is a blessing that I can't be thankful enough for. P.s. wine on Wednesday is half off ;)"", ""Driving by, I wouldn't have thought this restaurant would be so busy! It was packed from the moment we got there for happy hour, on a Monday, until we left mid dinner service. They had walk-ins on a waitlist, so I would recommend making a reservation in advance. They had a list of $6 cocktails on happy hour and a small list of bites as well. The HH bites didn't catch my eye, so we ordered from the main menu. Drinks: We ordered the lychee martini and an old fashioned. They do have a smoked old fashioned with fig bitters that has a fancy presentation, but it runs about $20. We went for a regular old fashioned and it was one of the best I've had in a while. I've had lychee martinis before, but didn't quite care for this one. Food: We asked if the crab in the coconut fried rice was imitation, and they were honest and said yes, which we appreciated. Instead, we ordered the pineapple fried rice, serve in half a pineapple. It was good, but quite spicy so keep that in mind. The lamb was also tasty and had a unique sauce we both enjoyed. The sampler plate was fun because we rated each item 1-5 based on our personal tastes, and we each rated different items higher. It gave us a chance to see what we might enjoy before ordering our entrees. Overall, the service was good. My only recommendation would be to train the server on the menu a little more. \xa0Every question we asked him, he had to go find out the answer. Overall, it was a fun experience for a birthday dinner and we surprisingly got a free dessert!"", ""I STAN 1618 ASIAN FUSION!Their stellar happy hour is just the tip of the iceberg IMO.

In the restaurant, I saw that they were featured in the Yelp's Top 100 place to Eat in 2021, and naturally it made me more excited for the meal. Let's just say, it lived up to hype! We arrived on a Saturday night, and it was busy! They quoted us 45-minutes, and they took our number down and luckily the table was ready in under 10. Great start. Looking at the menu they have a wide variety of dishes from different asian cultures. For starters we went with the XLBs which were delicious. We also went with the Peking Duck, which was alright, not sure if I'd spend $45 on it again, but it's what the bachelor guy wanted. Food presentation is something you can tell they put a lot of thought into.For my main, I decided to go with the 'Pho Rib'. When they say everything is bigger in a Texas, it's true. You should've seen the size of these tasty beer ribs, they low key looked pre-historic. The meat was tender and fell off the bone. Pair that with homemade fresh noodles, it was worth the $19. The also give you a side of an egg with some broth, I dunno what that was, but it was one of the best things i've ever tasted. Perfectly salty, rich and depth flavor, it was perfect for a cold winter night. As for the service, it really added to the entire experience. Our server Cassie, was professional, kind, and great to chat with. The restaurant is beautifully designed, and the theatrics that come along with some of their cocktails and desserts add to the overall vibe of the place. We even got a free-style rap by another server before we took off. Great night all around! If you are in the area or visiting and/or craving Asian food, this spot is worth checking out. Great for a nice dinner date or night out with a group of friends. Reservations are recommended since it is pretty popular."", 'Favorite meal on this trip to Texas--Houston, Austin, San Antonio. \xa0I was hard pressed to find good asian food in TX but left here a happy camper!Our group of 8 was able to order a number of their offerings. \xa0These are the items we were the most fond of: calamari, salted pepper; saigon chicken wings and the banh trang da nang (viet pizza). \xa0Calamari is calamari so was surprised at how good these were--solid battering and sauce. \xa0Balanced flavor on the chicken wings. \xa0The viet pizza was a clear hit with us, and we could not stop raving about it!Service was awesome. \xa0Waiter kept checking up on us and helped us move to be in the shade. \xa0This involved moving the tables, chairs and also the repositioning the canopy shading. \xa0We had lunch and chose outdoors. \xa0Be warned--not all tables will be shaded.Loved this place and can see why they are incredibly busy!']",positive

The waiter had a great personality and definitely wanted us to enjoy our experience. He pointed out his favorites, but didn't take it personally if we chose something else. The Tasca Rosé was wonderful. We also ordered the fettuccine gamberetto and said we wanted to share and he had the kitchen split it into separate dishes so we didn't have to. We also split an arugula prosciutto pizza with an egg on top per his suggestion. It was good but needed a little something more for my flavor preferences. The egg did add to it. It was too much food but so good. The sauce on the fettuccine was beautiful. Please check out this lovely little place that wasn't busy at dinner hour.

Happy hour was bearable and the bartender was super nice/friendly, hence the 2 stars instead of 1. The first time I went, the food was nothing to write home about. Mostly smaller portions, not very flavorful, and what I thought was overpriced. I figured I'd give it one more shot since I live so close by. My takeout tonight was the Mista salad w/ chicken (pictured) and was $18. Having never had it before, I figured it might be a nice dinner size salad for the price and description. I'd call what I got - weak, bland salad with rubbery chicken. I could have easily gone almost anywhere else in town to get a nice sized, fresh salad, for much less.

"['This location has reopened after being shut for renovations for a couple of months. They seem to be primarily focused on drive thru right now, as it was the only option on our recent visit.

They were doing an excellent job at keeping everything flowing smoothly and efficiently, with one person directing traffic and several others taking orders in each lane. The lane closest to the building was getting food from the drive thru window as is traditional, while the farther out lanes had runners bringing over the food (not unlike the old curbside pickup).

All three lanes were constantly moving and employees were getting orders taken fast. Before I even got to the window, my order was brought to me. I got the four piece chicken strips with honey mustard and a medium side of waffle fries. The strips were average in size, but delicious!! Tender and crispy. The fries weren't salted too much, which I find to be the best. And of course, the honey mustard went perfectly with both the fries and chicken.

It's filling though, but more like something to treat yourself. Still, they do a great job.

"[""I love the stirfried noodle dishes-- the pad see ew is great, especially with chicken, and if you ask they'll make it spicy for you, which I always enjoy! It's def a student-oriented place, with lots of utility seating. It's often packed, but they get you in and out (and well-fed) quickly, and it's never too long of a wait. The waitstaff is friendly, attentive, and helpful, and they take allergies very seriously. The decor is okay, lots of cool art, but pretty simple. The lighting is fairly low, but still gives off a sort of halogen vibe. No real complaints."", ""This is a very decent Vietnamese establishment. They shine with their tom kha soup and the seasoning on the beef.I had a vermicelli and beef noodle bowl and Tom kha soup. The soup was on par with all other places for this soup. The vermicelli bowl was good, but the portion of beef was not really enough. It was deliciously seasoned though. The overall bowl was a smaller portion than you'd expect, but it was enough for me for dinner. If you've got a big appetite, expect to finish it.The service was fine, and when they got my order wrong it came out correctly within 5 minutes. - I had ordered soup in the beginning so I wasn't starving.My friend has the pho (with beef) and she said that the beef was abnormally good, but the broth tasted more veggie based to her.

I'd likely check out other options first though."", 'Personally, any soup-based dish from ""Pho & I"" has been a big ""no-no"" for me. It was very bland and felt like it wasn\'t boiled for a long time because sometimes pho tasted like water. I think it would be better if it were more flavorful. Also, a lot of the times, the mushrooms in some of the soups, such as tom yum, were undercooked. However, I do really like their stir-fried dishes and crab rangoon!

I would usually order crispy chicken fried rice which is pretty good, though the portion size isn't the biggest.If you need thai food and can't walk any further, Pho & I will do.

I mean come on... check out the pictures! Dishes were generous and incredibly flavorful... Just the right amount of sauce! The tamarind duck was crispy and flavorful. And of course the mango sticky rice was divine. We ate everything including the garnish. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that the manager and owner used to work at another favorite restaurant called Pho Pasteur. It was really nice to see her be part owner of this place.

It's right by northeastern so the student crowd dominates this area but Pho and I is in a nice crux on Huntington Ave. Honestly it's a pretty decent restaurant with typical pho noodle soup but also other Thai options like Pad Thai or Pad See Ew. I went here for many years as a college student in Boston and it never disappointed especially on the college budget. For NEU students this place also accepts dining dollars which is clutch.Overall recommend this place on any occasion. It's a Huntington classic."", ""I would only recommend this place if you order delivery or pick-up because the noodles and meat come in a bowl to pour the broth into (if you order pho), which is really convenient if you're eating somewhere besides your house. Also their delivery/pick-up is super fast so that's a big plus. But flavor-wise, you're much better off going to Pho Basil which is only a few minutes away from this place. The broth tastes so watered down and bland, which is the opposite of what pho broth should be. Considering Pho Basil is so close by and such a big competitor, I'm honestly surprised that Pho & I hasn't upped their broth game yet.

We had a vegetable terrarium that was such a light finish and so visually appealing it looked like art.

Each menu item is bite size. We were full. Eating small portions in a prolong period does make one full. Our dinner was 3 hours. This is a nice spacious restaurant, they did not skim on rent or interior design. They are also well staffed. Street parking only. I took down a star bc there is a 20% mandatory gratuity. I don't think the service was worth that much in tips and I personally like options in tipping. Nothing spectacular with the service."", 'My wife and I came here for a special occasion - we don\'t go out for such fine dining often! We made a reservation for 2 at 5:30pm on a Saturday (1000 points on OpenTable, too). Being 5:30pm, the restaurant was pretty quiet (a total of 3-4 tables occupied near the end of our meal).Overall service was as you\'d expect for such a restaurant: impeccable. Tables are cleared as soon as the plates are finished but they were never intrusive, silverware replaced every course, bread crumbs cleaned off, etc. They even folded our napkins if we left the table for any reason! Well, like I said, we don\'t enjoy such fine dining very often.We chose the 7-course tasting menu. I had called ahead and arranged a vegetarian 7-course for my wife and a regular 7-course for myself (FYI, they are happy to do vegetarian versions of any number of courses, as long as everyone at the table has the same *number* of courses). We did not choose wine pairings, but the ginger lime soda was pretty good!Food arrived quickly. First, several courses of amuse-bouche (""snacks"" on the menu):1. Beet chip + beef tartare/beet tartare, watermelon infused with elderflower, nori chip + chicken liver mousse/roasted eggplant mousse: excellent start, elderflower was very subtle but the watermelon had an interesting crispy/crunchy texture to it, both the tartare and the mousse were rich and creamy and were well complemented by their respective chips.2. Oyster with savory/lovage, roasted zucchini: I\'m not the biggest fan of oysters so I won\'t comment on it, but my wife liked the roasted zucchini.3. Butter lettuce + halibut mousseline/porcini mousseline: so light, perfect crunch, no hint of grease at all, great balance.Then a bread course accompanied by lard + hazelnut and butter + browned butter bits on top. The bread was very light, airy, and chewy at the same time (thought slightly greasy), the lard was wonderfully rich (but I felt overwhelmed the hazelnut), but the best part was the browned butter bits: so much caramelization, so much depth of flavor!Third course: cucumber salad with lemon basil, mine had Dungeness crab. The crab was sweet and light, but I never expected the lemon basil to enhance the meatiness of the crab so much that for a second I did not think I was eating crab! Excellent pairing, though I felt that the vegetarian equivalent was a bit... lacking in imagination? Really, just cucumbers?Fourth course: grilled squid in foamed jus of mussels/stuffed nettle leaf with rice, various grilled aliums. I thought the squid was getting a little rubbery, but the grilled aliums were delicious with the jus (and who knew that garlic flowers are so pretty?). My wife thought the stuffed nettle leaf was good - just good.Fifth course: seared albacore/seared porcini, fermented garlic aioli, green bean/fava bean salad. The albacore was good, the aioli was great, but what blew me away was actually the salad: both beans were so young and tender and full of umami that it took me back to my childhood in China when I last had such flavorful beans (can\'t seem to find good ones here even in the farmer\'s market)! My wife thought the porcini was great, too - they actually managed to create a texture similar to the albacore with a seared outside and a tender inside, which I thought was quite neat.Sixth course (not on menu): tomato and beets salad with lemon sage. For someone who doesn\'t like beets, this was unexpectedly delicious: they were stewed for so long that they were fork tender, sweet, earthy, and well complemented by some savory and juicy tomato that certainly did not come from some greenhouse in Florida.Seventh course: grilled pork + fermented pork sausage + truffle aioli for me, grilled eggplant + grilled zucchini + scallion oil for her. First time having pork less than well done for me, it was good but not mind-blowing, overly lean and lacking in juice that had to be made up with the aioli. Pork sausage was Thai/Vietnamese-inspired - it was delicious. My wife thought the grilled eggplant/zucchini was quite good as well.Eighth course: the desserts have arrived!1. Almond custard and crumble, raspberry and lemon basil sorbet, fresh raspberries, anise: a variety of contrasting flavors, textures, and temperatures, very playful, refreshing, delicious.2. Roasted meringue, potato ice cream, Sherry ice: meringue was well caramelized and delicious, though I did not quite understand the point of potato ice cream - I don\'t think I tasted anything! Interesting concept, not entirely sure it worked out.(It was never explained why we got an extra course that was not on the 7-course menu, but on the chef\'s choice menu.)Final thoughts:Great ambience, fantastic service, great food. A few items were genuinely mind-blowing (e.g. lemon basil with Dungeness crab), most were very good, a few (e.g. potato ice cream) just OK. The vegetarian menu could have been more creative. Overall, it was a great experience.', ""Take all my money! This is a lovely place for a special occasion... we can afford it about every 2 years, but it doesn't disappoint. Yesterday's menu was fabulous. I would suggest either make the fois gras portion a little smaller, or the muffin bigger (yes, bigger muffins please). This course left us wanting more of a vehicle for the deliciousness.Actually, my last visit two years ago had antelope heart tartar on it, and had I not been in such a classy place, I would've spat it out. But...linen napkins, so I gulped it down. I had never had something so off-putting since that one time in 2006, when one of my high school students brought me some homemade haggis to try on a saltine.

The meal was creative, skillful, unique and flavors were balanced and mixed perfectly.

There is always one or two dishes from a chef choice meal that you just had to eat but really don't like. This wasn't the case here. Every dish was worth waiting for and definitely worth tasting. The price is amazing for this quality of food! We got the chef tasting menu. 10 dishes with many snacks totaling about 20 dishes.

B+)- beets chip with beef tartar (yum! A)- fried bread with pork fat and butter (a little greasy but the fried bread is creative. B) The main course!- geoduck with young coconut and lardo (very flavorful! A)- dungeness crab with grapefruit (the grapefruit looks like fish roe and adds a great tangy flavor to the creamy crab. A)- king salmon with warm squash (B+)- beets (Omg, this dish require some skills! I hate beets and he made it delicious and look like fish! A+)- foie gras with apple jelly and pear (Omg! A+)- hedgehog mushroom (B)- squab with black trumpets and wild licorice (A-)- beef culottes with black olives and turnip (A)The desserts!I thought the best was over but the desserts are even more crazy! - cranberry sorbet-like sheet over a creamy base mixed with nuts, tonka and olive oil. (A)- goat's milk with lime meringue (love the hint of goat cheese smell without it being too overbearing. A+)- sweet potato caramel with light ice cream and malt (my favorite! Had the flavor of cereal crunch and ice cream cone crunch. Also had a hint of burnt rice. This dish takes you back to your childhood. Well done and Yummy! A++)Will be back!"", 'We knew the prices going in but laughed at them going out. If you want a high caliber dinner with set tasting menus you may want to consider Beast, Roe, or Nodoguro.

The wagyu was definitely more delicious, but this was worth trying.-A5 Wagyu, Charred Eggplant Puree, Olive & Cherry Tapenade, Grilled Romaine (+$30 Supplement, yelp.com/user_local_phot…): Delicious- the wagyu was cooked a perfect medium rare, and melted in your mouth. I only wish the portion was bigger!-Rhubarb (yelp.com/user_local_phot…): Just ok for me- I didn't like the disk of rhubarb ice.-Goat's Milk, Raspberry, Lime (yelp.com/user_local_phot…): Not my favorite since I'm not a big goat's milk fan. The raspberry and lime flavors were nice though.-Shiso Cake (yelp.com/user_local_phot…): The cherry sorbet was really good, but the fresh cherries threw me off. The shiso tuille added a nice crunch though.-Mignardises (Strawberry Ice Cream w/Almond Coating, Salted Caramel Between Chocolate Discs, yelp.com/user_local_phot…): The strawberry ice cream bite was reminiscent of the Good Humour Strawberry Shortcake, but in bon bon form- which means it was delicious!

The honey mustard and ranch were like water. So thin. And that led to them having almost no flavor. The Asian salad was fine. But again it was bland. Not enough dressing. And the dressing itself was bland. The mediterranean chicken pitas could have been really good. The chicken was good. And this one had flavor. But it was just so wet from the salsa and that's before the tziki sauce. Drain your salsa before putting it on a sandwich! Just a mess when I ate it.

When we walked into our table there was seven other open tables I figured because of Covid kitchen staff behind maybe, or short handed. But it got worse from there we waited almost 25 minutes to order and she brought out our plates which were ice cold after they sat there for another 20 minutes waiting for pizza, \xa0so I couldn't eat my hot pizza off of my plate because it was ice cold because the air conditioning is blasting, a lot of people putting in sweaters and jackets, but that's fine I can't believe it takes over one hour for a pizza to be made BJ's.

"['We came to celebrate our anniversary and had a wonderful experience. To start, I ordered the cucumber gimlet (refreshing, balanced, secretly strong) and a crab cake appetizer. The crab cake was all crab with a delightful crust & lemon aioli. For the main, though I absolutely hate getting the same dish (I like trying and sharing), we both got the Chilean sea bass. It was absolutely amazing--light, buttery and it came with a side. I opted to swap for jalapeño au gratin and my bf got garlic mashed. Both delicious! We were too full for dessert, but our server surprised us with mango sorbet. The only negative was where we were seated, a table by the window where the valet stand was located- talk about blinded by the headlight.', 'Nothing is more disappointing than to see a bartender treat his friends at the bar like royalty, free drinks etc ...And we had to beg for service and drinks were served half full... btw the food prices during happy hour are a joke ...you better off ordering g from the regular menu...Just go across the street to Eddie V for much better atmosphere and value.Last time for me at Ocean Prime Orlando', ""As you walk in, you are greeted and provided great service. The interior is beautiful and it is crowded. The menu is full of interesting options. When you sit down, you get a bowl of free popcorn. I gave 3 stars because i did not feel the food and drinks were worth the price.We ordered the following:Goat cheese ravioli with mushrooms and sundried tomatoes : $19 appetizer that came with tiny raviolis that in my opinion were a little too salty, but maybe that should be expected with goat cheese. I also did not see or taste mushrooms. They must have been completely blended into the goat cheese filling. Still tasty, just would not order again.Jumbo lump crab cakes: keep in mind the appetizer comes with 1 crab cake for $24. Delicious though. Had a lot of crab. I probably would order it again if i was craving a good crab cake.prime roll: $23 sushi roll wrapped with thin rare prime beef and filled with tempura shrimp. Sounds unique right? It was tasty but if it didn't have the beef at all, i wouldn't have tasted the difference. spicy tuna roll: $24 and quite tasty! It is topped with a LOT of spicy mayo though (mixed with chunks of raw tuna). That one was my boyfriend's favorite.For cocktails, we tried the tequila cocktail (good but not mind blowing) and the pineapple picante (delicious!!! but, very VERY weak!!!!)I had 2 pineapple picante drinks on an empty stomach, which for me should have at least given me a little buzz. I didn't feel a thing. So it was definitely weak. And that was disappointing.Anyway, this doesn't mean i won't come back. I sure will. I like the atmosphere. Maybe i just didn't order the right things. Cheers!"", 'I was in town for a work function and a friend recommended we meet there for dinner.Service was top notch. \xa0Jesse was great with the drink, appetizer, main, and dessert recommendations.The table shared the calamari and the Ahi tuna. \xa0 Both had excellent presentation, tasted great and the portions were large enough for four people to share two appetizers.I selected the Scallops over risotto. \xa0These were some of the best scallops in terms of texture and firmness and flavor. \xa0I was a little disappointed that I only received four - in my opinion, six would have been a better portion size based on the size of the scallops.The table again shared two desserts and thoroughly enjoyed them. \xa0We had the 10 layer carrot cake and the warm butter cake. \xa0 Both portions were large and very tasty.I highly recommend reservations.', 'Five Stars.

The salmon was amazing and that sticky rice was the perfect touch. My friend ordered the steak and he had notbing but good things to say about it. For dessert we had the carrot cake and I\'m not the biggest fan of carrot cake but this was so decadent and amazing. I also ordered a tequila lemon drop and the bartender knew it safely what he was doing. The food, the ambiance, the service was amazing. I will definitely be back. Perfect date night for you and your boo!', 'Met friends for dinner, caught happy hour which provided great drinks. I had salad and their calamari for a filling meal. I was well pleased!', 'We enjoyed spending our anniversary at Ocean Prime. We first took a seat at their bar and ordered cocktails. The staff here are expert mixologist and they made me a prefect Manhattan.After our cocktails the server directed us to our table. A large bottle of sparkling water and a bottle of sauvignon blanc. For dinner I ordered oysters, cracked king crab, and butter cake for dessert.The oysters came with lemon, horseradish, and cocktail sauce. They were expertly shucked, clean, and tasty.My cracked king crab arrived. They give you a very generous amount of beautiful, tasty, and expertly cracked king crab. It is accompanied by a little pan of butter under heat, a very nice touch.The buttercup was accompanied by a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream and cream. The cake itself was very tasty, dense, and moist. The ice cream was very fresh, creamy, and flavorful.This is our first visit and I guarantee it will not be our last.', ""I've been wanting to come here for years because I had a friend who worked there and he always told me about it. I was taken on a birthday date here FINALLY last week and I enjoyed it. Fancy shmancy for sure. The bubbly berry cocktail is awesome. The filet was cooked perfectly although, my date said he didn't care for his filet that much. The service was pretty good outside of a couple awkward/stressful feeling interactions. It was a Friday night and very busy. The jalapeño au gratin potatoes were super tasty. And they gave me a free birthday dessert! I would come here again but not sure I'd get steak again. At least not the filet. Would probably try a fish dish next time."", ""Very classy beautiful setup inside and staff shoes go above and beyond to help and take care of you. \xa0Made reservations here to celebrate our anniversary. We were a few minutes late because of the traffic in the area but they sat us right away and started taking a drink order a minute after we sat. The wine menu was huge but I especially loved the whiskey and bourbon menu since they had some rarer bottles that's tough to find or get like the Yamasaki 30 year and dalmore cigar blend. \xa0We started off with appetizers getting raw and charbroiled ones they even gave us a extra half dozen for taking a tad linger longer then normal. Both of course very fresh the charbroiled had a good amount of cheese and tasted perfectly. Also ordered the steak tar tar which we all loved especially with the quail egg in it. For the main course we got the ribeye Oscar style, the New York steak, and glazed salmon. For the sides creamy spinach, Brussels, tater tots and baked potato. \xa0The steaks were cooked to perfection cut like butter and just melted in your mouth. The salmon oh man was delicious especially with the teriyaki glaze over rice. The Brussels were crisp and the spinach tasted so good with the bacon in it. The tater tots with the sauce were probably our favorite side to have. \xa0 To finish it all off for the night we ordered the butter cake with ice cream and this by far is the best dessert because it was super moist soft and went so well with the fruit and ice cream. If you want a fancy night out this is the place to go to."", ""We had a wonderful New Year's Eve dinner here last night. The food and service were outstanding, and it was a perfect location for a special night out. Everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed their food from the appetizers to the entrees to the side dishes. The filet and lobster tails were delicious. All of the sides were outstanding, but the standouts included the jalapeño au gratin potatoes and the brussel sprouts. For cocktails, the berry martini (I forget the name, but the one with dry ice) is one of the best drinks I ever had. We sat in the lounge area, and we were treated to some great live music.

The portions are large enough to share, but we were glad we didn't because we would have hogged the sauces.

(Neither of us are into spicy chicken so we kept to the original recipe.) Everything is made to order, which means waiting a bit (about 15 minutes) but that meant our food was super fresh. We opted to take our food to go rather than eat at the location, but we found a park nearby and ate there, so the food was still hot.I enjoyed my sandwich, though I thought the $10 price tag was a bit steep for just one original chicken patty, lettuce, tomato, and sauce on a bun with fries. My husband's tenders were about $12 and came with fries, creamed corn, and mac'n'cheese and was probably the better meal deal. He's kind of a chicken tender connoisseur and said that they were great tenders. So take that as you will. I liked the fries, which were seasoned with something extra (cinnamon??) and were really good."", ""I've always been a fan of Happy Chicks and this weekend's visit really prompted me to write this review.I was having one of those days where I'd been nonstop busy and had yet to eat by the time 2:30pm rolled around. \xa0Hungry had turned to hangry and the fate of my day really depending on my impending meal. \xa0I decided Happy Chicks was up to the task.Let me tell you -- this meal was a spiritual experience on this day. \xa0I ordered the Classic Chick which is a larger meal than the Happy Chick which is what I would normally order. \xa0I got a text that my order was ready about 10 minutes before I got to the restaurant. \xa0Speedy! \xa0However, the hanger in me was nervous the food would be cold by the time I got it home.... WRONG.Everything was still hot and fresh. \xa0The chicken was crispy and juicy, fries perfectly seasoned, and the mac and cheese is always the main event in my eyes. \xa0Needless to say, my hanger quickly turned to bliss and then to coma.One of the best things about Happy Chicks is the number of sauces the offer. \xa0They have a sauce for everyone! \xa0I do wish their sauce cups were a bit larger... but if that's my only complaint then I'm happy.Long story long, go to Happy Chicks."", ""Tried this little spot with my dad after he read the chronicle and saw it was one of Austin's top chicken places. They've got a small menu, but 15 types of sauce to choose from. The inside smelled a little funky (like eggs) which is strange because I didn't see anything with egg on the menu.

They have a running sink outside to wash your hands if you decide to dine outside which is very nice and convenient.

I ordered Risotto cakes and eggs and my daughter order the Chorizo scramble. Both dishes arrived fast and were delicious. My order came with a warm croissant and jam. So delicious!', ""Overall: Cute neighborhood breakfast and brunch place. Prices aren't too bad, upwards of $13 (11/2021) for a meal. Atmosphere: This place is usually packed and has a wait time in the mornings but so far has never been more than an half an hour. For the winter the have closed off their outdoor seating and have added heaters making it a tolerable place to sit and eat. Indoor seating is cozy and has a soothing laidback ambiance even though it is usually packed. I just wish they had some soft French music playing in the background to complete the full experience. Food: Tried the pomegranate mimosas and they were pretty good. I would still prefer the traditional orange juice mimosa. Also had a latte and it was as delicious as it gets. It had a rich flavor and was not to hot, ready to drink right when it arrives. The croissants are the beat ones I've had. They were buttery and flatly and fresh. They were great with the strawberry jam and also combined well with the latte. - Isaiahs French Skillet- It was lacking flavor and salt. There was no one dominating flavor. Everything was very subtle. The bearnaise sauce was absolutely delicious, but once I added it to the skillet it got lost. The Brie cheese was nice on there, but once again was a subtle flavor that didn't add to the dish. I think the chicken-basil sausage was not my favorite thing. I think this dish would be better with shredded chicken. Also the dish was lacking seasoning. -The Corner Beef Hash was much better. The horseradish-shallot cream sauce was yummy and paired well with the brisket. The two sunny side eggs were a good addition. - La Provence Benedict was delicious. If you're looking for a meal to get you full, this is it. It comes on a toasted croissant with a piece of thick ham and eggs with traditional Hollandaise sauce. Was very good. -If you're looking for something with a gazillion calories try the Monte Cristo. It's dipped in egg batter and then toasted giving it a nice French toast vibe. Was very good, just a lot of calories. Service: It's usually very busy so don't expect the most attentive servers. However when they are at our table they are very friendly."", 'We decided to go to Beaverton to have lunch a decided to try La Provence based on the Yelp reviews. \xa0Wow, we super loved the ambiance and decore. \xa0Once inside you see the the pastry counter with amazing treats.

Waited 45 mins for brunch on a Saturday afternoon which is to be expected because everybody be brunchin'.Our waitress was super nice and speedy. She constantly filled up our coffee and water which at some places is surprisingly hard to come by. Our food also came out almost instantaneously after we ordered; what sort of sorcery is this! The crossiant that came with my Isaiah's French Skillet was too bready for my liking. It doesn't really stand on its own as a pastry; not buttery enough. But it does work pretty well as part of a dish like the La Provence Benedict instead of English muffin. The Isaish's French Skillet was nice! I enjoyed the crispy hash at the bottom and the egg was filled with many goodies like chicken basil sausage, veggies, and brie cheese. Although the dish was a little bland as a whole, I never had anything like it before so trying it out was fun. Thr La Provance Benedict was also decent. Using crossiant instead of English muffin was fun but besides that everything was pretty standard; good poaches eggs, creamy holandish sauce, and high quality ham. I did like that the crossiant sobbed up all the creamy sauce and yolk pretty well.The dishes we had today maybe good but they still don't beat the Nouvelle Date Scramble which we had at another Petite Provence branch! Overall, definitely happy with this place. Super nice to be able to take our time and enjoy brunch by a nice lake. Also, don't knock their hot sauce!"", ""Went back today and was full and happy when it was time to go....I love how the staff is friendly and the food is continually delish.

Headed to the next window for my order and exited out the patio.The items were packaged well and the croissants in a separate bag with jam. I remember croissants coming with cheese too but maybe that isn't the case anymore for to go orders. The entrees were large portions, though the salmon hash was very salty and the monte cristo had a nice sweet touch. The fruit on the side was a nice variety of pineapple,kiwi, and other fruits which was surprising as some places it can be more of a garnish.

They sent me the roll unaltered, with no communication therefore I was unable to eat it. I called to tell them that there had been a mistake and the women answered the phone and proceeded to laugh and talk to her friend for there first 30 seconds, while I tried to speak, then dismiss my concern and rudely explain that they follow the menu ingredients and don't do substitutions and that I can take it up with Uber eats.

She suggested this restaurant. Took a bit of searching but eventually we found it and had a great meal.Tons of what you would expect from a sushi restaurant. My only real downer from it is that special rolls were all priced the same at $12.50. Alas, plenty of other options for a cheap and filling meal.That aside, our meal was great. Portions were sized nicely overall and tasty. Their spicy chopped scallop rolls were a lot better than I expected. Not the overwhelming bit of spiciness that you would expect from spicy rolls.

"[""Came here for their Bite of Burnaby menu at $60 per person. We had their potato chowder soup, petite filet, chicken breast, chocolate bar and raspberry tart for our 3 courses.

The set menu was really worth it and I would recommend going for dine-out.', 'Atlas Steak + Fish is a North American steakhouse located at the heart of Burnaby. Situated inside Delta Hotel by Marriott Burnaby Conference Centre, this place has been one of my go-to dining places for years. I went for their dineout menu this year.My overall dining experience was pleasant and unique. The highlight of the menu is the desserts! The Raspberry Lemoncello Tart was exquisite and unique. The raspberry sorbet was refreshing and the almond meringue balanced out the lemoncello. For the entrees, I recommend the Maple Cured Salmon Steak (ask for medium). The seasoning was so unique and tasty! Unfortunately, the appetizers did not impress me. As usual, their freshly baked bread was on point . Their tuna tartare was delicious as well .', ""I little bit of a whirlwind on this visit. We didn't have a reservation ion, so we were told the wait would be about 45mins. That's cool, we'll kill some time at the casino.45 mins pass and I don't feel like losing anymore, so I check on the wait. No table available yet and I'm getting hangry. Thankfully, a table opened up about ten mins later and we were seated.The place was busy and the staff wasn't nearly as attentive as our previous visit. It took some time before our server got around to us. She was pleasant enough, but it would be a while before we saw here again.45mins later, we ask about our food and are told it's coming in a couple mins and our server gave us a salad on the house to keep us busy.Another 15mins pass and I'm no longer hungry. I wave down some staff and let them know we were going to leave and are okay with paying for the salad. The manager gets involved and insists we stay. He offers what sounded like 50% off our meal and genuinely seemed apologetic. He says the food is moments away and being exhausted and not wanting to make it a big deal we stay.The food arrives with plenty of apologies. I ordered the cioppino and it looks and smells delicious. My wife ordered the tomahawk pork chop and it look delightful. As for the taste? Fantastic. No problem with any of the food itself. In fact, we both liked it so much we'd likely order the same again.Once our dinner was complete, our server gave us a light dessert to again apologize for the lengthy delays. I really appreciate the team trying to make things right. I only wish I was more hungry, cu I think it would have tasted even better.So now here's where things get weird. We are told by our server that the manager has approved again what sounded like 50% off. I guess I was wrong. It was 15% off and the server only reduced the price of one of our dishes. I can't be bothered to deal with this and pay the bill.I wanted to give a lower star rating, but everyone ultimately tried to do their best to make a bad situation better and I really appreciate that. It's a tough going right now in the food and beverage industry. With that in mind, I give them five stars for the team's effort.Let's just not let the lengthy wait happen again, ok?"", ""For Valentine's Day, my husband and I decided to go to Atlas Steak + Fish, one of our favourite restaurants. Despite booking nearly a month in advance, the only time slot we could get was 4:45pm on Saturday February 13th (although we managed to push it back when a 5:15pm slot opened up).One advantage to having an early seating is that we were there during happy hour (which had been extended to 6:30pm), so we were able to get cocktails and wine (of which we had several glasses) at their happy hour prices.For dinner, we went with their Valentine's menu: a glass of sparkling wine, tomato bisque soup as an appetizer, a steak and seafood platter to share (we added on a mushroom side), and for dessert, chocolate ganache torte and Baked Alaska. As usual, everything was delicious, and the service was FANTASTIC.Atlas Steak + Fish never fails."", ""Oh my goodness Atlas, where have you been all my life? It's almost embarrassing how late I'm jumping onto the Atlas bandwagon because \xa0 \xa0I previously lived in this neighborhood way before the casino was even built. I've known that there are restaurants inside the hotel/casino but I never really did my research of how good it was. We finally decided to try Atlas to celebrate our anniversary and was blown away by the service (of our waitress Bridgette), the food (omg the food), and the ambience (omg it's beautiful inside). We ordered the clams and mussels as a shared appetizer, I had the tomahawk pork chop, and my husband got a sirloin with the lobster oscar topping. Let me start by saying that the clams and mussels at Atlas are the best we've ever had. We almost always get the clams and mussels at any seafood/french restaurant but Atlas' clams and mussels definitely gets top marks for it's flavour. The sauce was deep and flavourful.. oh soooo good. And the portion was great for sharing. The entrees were amazing - the tomahawk pork chop is huge for one person. After sharing the mussels and clams and the bread, I just couldn't finish the pork chop despite it being very juicy and flavourful. My husband's sirloin with the lobster oscar topping was also amazing. We were so full that we declined a dessert but Bridgette wouldn't let us go until we had an anniversary cheesecake on the house. It was amazing as well. Full marks for Atlas. We'll definitely be back and will definitely be trying their happy hour."", 'Great place!My wife and I decided to go here on our first anniversary,glad we did.Our server was so good,the food was awesome.Great setting we were right next to the piano and he played some great songs.Great experience I highly recommend this restaurant.', ""My fiancé and I have been wanting to come here for a while after friends of ours raved about the Langley location. It's definitely outside of what we would normally spend on a night out, but we decided to take advantage of the fact that they are participating in Dine Out Vancouver and we were not disappointed! $40 each for a 3 course meal. They also have the option of having a glass of wine with each course for an extra $17 which I opted for and it was totally worth it! Although our waiter could have been more attentive by asking how each course was, he was very helpful when it came to drink selections and was quite friendly. What we ordered: appetizers: parsnip soup and wedge salad. My fiancé had the salad which he says was very good, but I went for the parsnip soup which honestly, didn't sound all that appealing but I can't stand blue cheese which was on the salad. The soup pleasantly surprised me- it was somehow so creamy and absolutely delicious! Would definitely order again.For our entree, we each had the prime rib. The only difference is my fiancé got the gentleman's cut which was larger- 8oz compared to 6oz. The meat was cooked to perfection, so tender and juicy. It was served Yorkshire pudding and mashed potatoes. I found the \xa0Yorkshire pudding to be a bit underwhelming, but my mom makes the best so it's hard for me to find anything that competes . Lastly, dessert. We ordered one of each- the spiced chocolate ganache torte end the baked Alaska. The chocolate ganache was very weird.. the spice is odd and unnecessary. I can see they are trying to make it unique for chocolate torte, but it just didn't seem right. However, the baked Alaska is a MUST HAVE. Sooo delicious and had me wondering how the heck they make it. It's frozen strawberry ice cream somehow baked inside a thin layer of cake and the final outside layer is something like a meringue. Very unique and a definite signature dish. All in all, we would definitely like to come back here again maybe for a special occasion in the future."", ""Atlas is a restaurant situated in the hotel and next to the casino. While I usually hesitate about hotel restaurants, this is not the same.Everything was prepared with care and they have well thought out menu. The food combinations follow classic American steak houses but with a west coast flair.Service was attentive and quick. Wait staff was knowledgeable and personable.We have been twice now and had a good experience each time. Highly recommend their rib steak for two and the duck cassoulet with foie gras. Also recommend getting the baked Alaska for dessert. Unfortunately due to covid they are not doing table side baked Alaska, but it definitely would be one of the meal's highlights.Once you enter the restaurant the atmosphere changes, good for dates or a nice dinner out for adults. The booths are very comfy and you get a good distance from every table which keeps your table's conversation private.Will definitely be returning again."", 'Located on the second floor in the Delta Hotel/Grand Villa Casino, this hidden gem is one of my new favourite steak houses. The restaurant is large and spacious, with modern decor and is a great place to have a nice meal, or to visit on a special occasion.Have tried many items on the menu, but my favourite items are still the warm baby kale and spinach salad where the dressing is flambéd table side, calamari, tomahawk steak, blue cheese gnocchi, and baked Alaska. Every meal is served with freshly baked table bread and blue cheese butter. I\'m not a fan of blue cheese, but I\'m coming around because of Atlas! I rarely ordered salads when I\'m out, but this one is so good - there\'s like 13 ingredients in the dressing from shallots, shitakes, and sun dried tomatoes. Dressing is delicious and nice to have the salad warm and slightly wilted. The calamari body comes grilled in their Josper oven and tentacles fried, served over a tomatoes based sauce, and goat cheese toasties. Smokey, sweet, tangy and savoury a perfect balance of flavour. The star of the meal is of course the 48oz tomahawk steak. This required a wait of about 30-35 minutes, but it is worth it! Comes served presided on a platter over roasted potatoes, a delicious Madagascan green peppercorn sauce, and a side salad. The steak is deliciously charred and Smokey, and pairs perfectly with the sauce. At $130 this is definitely an item for a special occasion, but if you can afford it I highly recommend it! The blue cheese gnocchi is a little denser than normal, but is still fluffy and soft, and the blue cheese is not overpowering - and this is coming from someone who doesn\'t enjoy blue cheese!Amazing meal, good service, no complaints.

The app arrived at the same time as main course and was quite oily for my taste. I did ask the waiter about it prior to placing the order and he assured it was not an oily dish.

The Jjampong was not spicy and had a decent amount of seafood and vegetables for the size of the bowl it was in. Sweet & Sour Pork ($18) - A bit disappointed when this one came out. Portion size was a bit lacking for the price.

Well, I hate to say it, but it was a disappointment. Theirs just didn\'t taste authentically Korean. But then this is a Chinese-Korean restaurant, and I guess they did it more Chinese style? Not to say that these items tasted bad, but just not the taste that I qualify as ""authentic"" Korean-style Jjajangmyun or Tangsuyuk. Not enough soy sauce, not enough sugar or something!! What I had recently in Utah, at Paik\'s Noodles, now THAT was the all-out authentic taste that I\'ve grown to love...totally different from what I had here.The Green Noodles used for Jjangmyun tasted fresh, but actually looked better than they tasted, I guess.

Everything we ordered was delicious. I recommend anything with the chicken. Anything."", ""I can't believe I haven't written a review for Buttermilk yet. It's arguable one of my favorite breakfast/brunch places in town. Parking is one of the two drawbacks to this place. It can be tough to find a spot on the weekends, even though they keep expanding where you can park on the nearby lots. Just be sure to look at the signs to make sure what's allowed on what day. Of course the second drawback is the wait time, since everyone and their mom wants to come here. But just put your name in, chit chat with your friends, or go walk nearby and catch some Pokemon. Once your turn is up, they'll text you.Pro Tip: sign up for the bar as a seating option too. Majority of the times I've gone, I've sat there instead of a regular table. What can I say about the food, just about everything there has been delicious. I typically like to make my own combos, but the bacon is a staple, as are their biscuits and jam.

Highly recommend!- Pimento cheese was very rich and creamy- Loved the red pepper jelly. Wish it had more of a kick to it.- Pickled tomatoes were interesting! First time having them.- The bread was beautifully toasted. Looked like the same bread they use for their French toast. Perfect amount of butter.- 10/10Chicken and waffle $17- Very overpriced for what it was- Chicken had decent flavor but texture was a bit soggy. Wasn't fried recently- Waffle texture was limp and did not taste any better than homemade waffles.- Both items were lukewarm.- Maple syrup was warmed up for us!- 4/10Biscuit and gravy $11- Biscuit texture was decently fluffy!- Gravy was lacking in flavor. A bit peppery but nothing else stood out.- Too expensive for the quality.- 6/10Overall Buttermilk kitchen seems a bit overhyped. The food quality to price ratio was a bit disappointing.

There's also parking in the neighboring buildings on certain days. My friend and I split the pimento cheese appetizer which we LOVED. The accoutrements it comes with perfectly balance the slightly fatty and salty pimento cheese. It came with grain crackers, baguette-like bread, pickles, pickled tomatoes, and a lovely jam. An extremely well balanced dish! My friend and I split two entrees together which were the fried chicken and waffle as well as the biscuits and gravy. The fried chicken was juicy and tender but the skin was rather flat and non crispy unfortunately. It also wasn't very hot (temperature wise). The waffle wasn't crispy either, it felt like the both elements of this dish were prepared beforehand buffet style and they just grab it from the pan. It was a rather lukewarm endeavor if you will. The biscuits were well made and were nice and fluffy. The gravy left me wanting more in terms of flavor and depth, seemed slightly peppery but nothing else.Overall, this place isn't worth the hype but I wouldn't mind coming here to try some other stuff though it is rather pricey for the quality you get.""]",positive
"['I have been coming here for the last few years to pick blueberries multiples times throughout the season! They have so many varieties of blueberries, all which are delicious!

Super big berries, some the size of a quarter! Not too tart and right amount of sweetness for $4 lb. Get a stamp card and you get a free pound after 10lbs. They have some of their own food trucks- must get the frozen blueberry lemonade and blueberry donuts!!Their gift shop has some cute stuff- I recommend the honey.Sunflower field is gorgeous and great for influences, you now have to pay to enter the area but you do get a free sunflower with admission.Large strawberry you pick- lots lots lots of berries! Peaches you pick- never tried them, but it looks like a big hit.They have different activities throughout the year, a great place for families. Clean restrooms.

The sunflower and strawberry fields were in full bloom, the prices are being kept the same, and there are free shuttle rides via tractor to and from end fields - which is an awesome addition! There were multiple food trucks options for visitors, and all of it was very reasonable/delicious. While the seasonal strawberry donuts don't compare to the apple cider ones (personal opinion), the blueberry deserts and handcrafted lemonade is fantastic! Even though it's only $2.50 per glass, our group easily spent $20 on refills and the frozen slush version. We had the chance to listen to some live music, and I hope they come back to play often!!

It's free to enter the facility and enjoy most of those features. Parking is also free. This includes fire pits (excellent on a cold/windy day like the day we came, a covered area with various food vendors including dessert: donuts, coffee, frozen lemonade and another vendor with hot food: such as hot dogs, French fries and even adult beverages. There are also food trucks that occasionally run with other options. Even on a freezing day they had live music as well. We walked up right during a performance of Strawberry Fields. Talk about Serendipity. For the kids along with picking fruit and flowers they have a free park for kids. For additional cost they have a children fun zone. Prices vary based on child's height. The fun zone includes actual rides.. like a carousel, bouncing pad and more. Unfortunately for us it was closed the day we came due to inclement weather but it looked very fun. During our visit they had sunflowers and strawberries in season. They rent wagons for $8 which come super in handy while picking fruit and toting around a toddler. It's free to pick strawberries but it does cost money $4/Ib which is very fair for how amazing their strawberries taste. The employee working the strawberry stand giving out the trays for picking explained to us the two different flavors they offered which were both scrumptious. We had a blast picking them ourselves and went home with a pretty hefty load. Sunflowers were also in season. We were poofed from picking Strawberries so we decided to just take a few cute photos in front of the flower field and purchase some pre-cut sunflowers instead. Just as beautiful and they package it up for you. They have lots of cute photo spots with rustic trucks. We cannot wait to come back during peach, zinnias, blueberries and pumpkin season. I am thrilled to make more family memories with delicious fruit!!!"", 'Great way to spend the day with family, alone, or a romantic day! This Farm has a free entrance (unless you go to the sunflower field which is $6And each person gets one sunflower) and is cashless venue (only cards/ apple pay), so yay for safe options! \xa0They have foodtrucks, seasonal items to eat and a shop. They also have machines and game for the little ones, so be ready to spend a good 2 hours! My fave thing to eat was the grilled cheese with gouda cheese and blueberry jam and the mimosa! The venue is huge,So even though is always packed you will have PLENTY of space to roam around.', ""Would definitely be returning when it's less cold outside! Even with it being cold today, we all had a wonderful time, they did have a lot of accommodations for the cold weather such as a few fire pit areas that were free to seat around (they did offer s'more's making kits for an additional price) the food trucks offered hot chocolate, hot coffee. They did have strawberry donuts \xa0which were amazing just wish they were warm! I paid $6 for a 1/2 dozen, so a 1$ each.We paid $12.49 for a box tray. I wanna say it was $4 a pound. They had quite a few fields of strawberries to choose from.They had live music and a playground area, corn hole games, A large connect to four-game, a lot of covered patio area, and rides! The staff was friendly and helpful! Overall I would recommend it to anyone, our family will be back soon!"", 'Definitely worth driving from orlando to clermont kn a sunday funday with the fam. Strawberry and blueberry picking was so much fun that even us parents enjoyed it. Fun activity to do with your kids. \xa0No entrance fee. Just pay for by the pounds. What really made it awesome was the various foodtruck and kids activities to do here. They had giant slides, carousel, \xa0bungee jumping, smores pit, swings, etc etc.', ""Went today for the second year, to get some donuts, lemonade and sunflowers!! I have to say, most of all of the employees were wonderful and sooooo friendly. I love that about this place, except the girls at the petting zoo, they didn't even bother to say hello. They looked annoyed and bored. I noticed a few things about it this year. The price was double because they added a corn maze and some jumpers as well as rides for kids. While it is wonderful for the kids, what happens to the families that have newborns or no kids? Then, they all have to pay for the new additions that they are not enjoying? Would be better to just have parents buy tickets instead, but no, everyone needs to pay for the increase. That seemed greedy to me. I also noticed that the blueberry lemonade didn't have any blueberries for garnish, that would be a great touch to the lemonade! This is the last weekend and they ran out of tumblers and pumpkin beer. Also, the donuts are not as fresh tasting as they are on the weekend. I think maybe it could be because they are at the bakery rather than the normal place, they probably fry it and then send it over to the bakery. Tarah was very nice though. The tractor driver today was AMAZING. He had a wonderful personality and great jokes! I think he works at Disney, very fitting. He stopped the tractor to tell us a little more about the blueberries and picking season. He made our day. The restrooms are pretty clean, I just wish that there were paper towels in there rather than just air dryers. It is also air-conditioned in there, so that definitely helps with the warm temperatures. They did not have any of the fire pits going today, maybe they just light them when someone purchases the s'more packages. I am not sure if it is because it was a weekday, but it is unfortunate that the weekday tickets do not get the same things as the weekend tickets. Prices are the same as well. There were only two food trucks today, and then the little service window inside with burgers. Not many food options and if you are a vegetarian, you have slim pickings.  If amenities will be cut during the week, then prices should be a little less for tickets. I'll put that in their suggestion box lol The two ladies at the sunflower area distributing scissors were very kind as well. There were a couple of employees riding little utv's were driving very fast and didn't slow down. They need to be more careful. Overall, I give 3 stars for \xa0this year and that was for the majority of the wonderful staff and how they care for the farm. Will still be back next year but"", ""By far one of the best places in Lake county where you can enjoy with the entire family! There are a variety of food trucks for you to chose from. My favorite is the Southern Hill Bakery! Their frozen blueberry lemonade is delicious! This past weekend my girlfriend's and I decided to visit and have an early Galentine's Day outing. Many of them had never been. They all feel in love and let me know that they'll be back with their families. If you're ever looking for something different and fun this is the perfect place.The staff is very accommodating and friendly I was lucky to meet Samantha who recommended the best spot for us to enjoy the farm, and Chris who made all of feel welcome! You can thank me later!""]",positive
"[""Popped in for a few pops and a few snacks before the main event. We didn't have resos, but we go out early because we arent as hip as we used to be, so they accepted our walk in party of 4 just as they opened the door. Service was good, food was great, especially the wings and the Pulpo.The fermented cabbage was also tasty but you had to really move the cabbage around in the sauce to pick up the balance of flavours.....maybe drizzle a bit more liberally? \xa0The other 3 at our table sampled the cabbage and decided it wasn't for them, so I took it upon myself to finish it off...my advice? Be the finisher....cabbage marinated longer in the sauce and picked up so many flavours. And don't forget to swirl. Good stuff."", ""The food, service, and atmosphere were amazing. My partner and I finished our night with their szechuan pepper beigniets and they were...interesting? The desert may not be for everyone but it honestly blew my mind in terms of what food can be. Not only did the flavour have me coming back for seconds but the numbing sensation provided by the Szechuan peppers was really something I've never experienced before. I would definitely recommend this restaurant! Lots of love,Owen"", ""Delightfully delicious, and after being away for 2 years (due to COVID closures), PiDGiN was just what we were looking for during our recent trip.PiDGiN crafts an intimate and thoughtful fusion experience. Food was executed wonderfully, and each course delivered a symphony of textures, flavors, and visual appeal.We heard wonderful things about their tasting menu, so that's what we went with. We started off with an amuse of pickled kohlrabi, house made kimchi. Then came the sashimi with tuna, cucumber, grapefruit, shiso in a delicate and balanced shoyu ponzu. This was a great start - the only thing I would have liked more of was shiso.Afterwards, the meat of the tasting experience began, and boy, did it pack quite the punch! Sous vide octopus with orange sake vinaigrette was bright in flavor and very tender octopus. I have never had sous vide octopus before so I was thrilled with how tender, soft it was. The texture allowed the flavors to really permeate and you could taste it with each bite. The jalapeño sanshozuke creme fraiche packs a surprising heat that slowly creeps up on you, so might be something worth mentioning if you don't like spicy food. Confit potatoes were good, though didn't do a whole lot for the dish itself.The journey wrapped up with a butter-poached halibut, elk striploin, and carrot cake. Halibut had great ginger flavors and texture with the vegetables. The fish was super fresh and tasted great; just a little overcooked. If you don't choose to go with the tasting, you MUST get the elk striploin. That was a definite WOW dish! It was the combination of coffee celeriac puree that brought it to a whole new dimension and it not only pairs amazingly well with the elk, but also the chanterelles. Even the rapini took on a new flavor profile with that puree. Topped with a red wine jus, and I'm still dreaming about that dish. It was definitely the highlight of the evening. Carrot cake was good, and the right portion after all the previous dishes.Service was fabulous - attentive, warm, jovial and informative. Pricing at $85CAD per person was just right. Covid protocols and enforcement on point, which we appreciate. Love the environment and flow of the space. We were super lucky to be seated on the side with the bar, so it was quiet and you felt like you were on your own little island. Washrooms clean too. Don't be alarmed with the location of the restaurant - it has grit and speaks to the eclectic mix of businesses that are popping up here. Just be aware of your surroundings.In total, the experience lasted a little over 2 hours. If you are in a hurry, I would not recommend going with the tasting experience. Some of the courses were spaced 20 minutes in between, so if you're looking to take your time, you will have an enjoyable experience.This is definitely one of those places to come back to each season, and we look forward to our next visit already!"", 'When you walk in, it is very romantic and dark when you sit down they give you immediate service and give you your menus. The three favorite dishes of mine were the Korean bbq wings because of the amazing balance of meatiness and spiciness. Next, my second favorite dish was the spring risotto given the fact me and my brother were scooping every last drop of risotto sauce. Then, the rice cake with bolognese was my third favorite because of the amazing spiciness of the rice cake which I love. In summary, this restaurant, Pidgin is the perfect place for romance and bringing your date or a group of adults and all the wonderful dishes are perfect for groups and a date and you.', ""Pidgin is a fusion restaurant with some really awesome takes on various Asian cuisines. I only got a chance to try their rice bowls (pictured) so this review is based off those.Both the pork belly and the foie gras were some of the yummiest renditions of those that I've had a chance to eat. You can tell a lot of care was put into preparing them, and each are complimented by garnishing inoffensively -- these dishes definitely seem like crowd-pleasers to me so I wouldn't hesitate bringing a first date, in-laws, etc.The atmosphere is great (dim lit, not too loud) and service is friendly. Drinks were pretty good, but I wouldn't come here just because of them.Holding back from 5 stars because it is a little pricey for the portion size, and I'm not sure if that is worth the trip as you can get high quality dons for much cheaper elsewhere, and can find fusion places that take more risks. I'm very excited though to come back and try some more of their menu!"", 'We ordered the tasting menu as it was recommended that gives us the variety of the food offerings. The food was ok but not spectacular for the price of the tasting menu. \xa0Other tasting menu restaurants serve each party on separate plates as that is part of the experience. There were 3 people who had the tasting menu and all three portions came in one bowl/ plate for us to separate ourselves. The experience was not as good as expected especially for the price that was paid. Service was also mediocre.', ""Great service. Food was punch you in the face flavourful. Carrot cake lives up to its reputation and I don't even like carrot cake. Great vibe. Cons include seating guests faster to avoid a crowd, change up the sake selection and the staff forgot one of our orders. Not a big deal because we were not charged for it but not a good thing either. We'll be back."", ""I've eaten here I think 3 times and it's been excellent. \xa0Thought they deserved a review. Location is across from Pigeon Park in the 'gritty' section of town but don't let that distract you. I've eaten all over the US and Europe and this is a top tier restaurant. It's kind of a fusion type restaurant I suppose. \xa0Very innovative. They have a delicious tasting menu. \xa0We had poached halibut with corn and shaved zucchini bamboo shoots and a delicious sauce. I forget the ingredients but it was stellar. Then we had pork belly with rice and it was sublime. \xa0Service is attentive but low key and everything was outstanding. \xa0This place is running on all cylinders. Worth a visit. They know what they're doing. Highly recommended."", 'I have been going to PiDGin since they opened, and have always enjoyed their food, cocktails and service. Very glad to see them reopen. I ordered delivery the other day and had:Mushrooms with ""ramen"" egg - this was very nice, I recommend heating it up in the microwave a bit. The accompanying butter sauce was packed separately and the dish was delicious. Pork Gyoza - this was... stodgy. I don\'t really want to knock down anyone, especially now, but I think this dish needs a rethink or be removed. The wrapper was gummy and thick, the meat filling had a taste and texture that was also gummy and... dull. Brussel sprouts - they packed the miso sauce separately which was nice. My first bite out of the box was not that good (strong cabbage-y bitter taste), but then I reheated it quickly in the microwave, AND HOLY COW, it was DELICIOUS!! Wow, so much flavour got released with just a small application of heat, and it was still nice with a bit of firmness. I think they undercook it so you can heat it up and it will be perfect.Overall, I was happy with my order. I will be ordering again soon!', 'Yum! First time trying out pidgin. It was very easy to make a reservation online, and the table I reserved for 6 was very spacious. We appreciated the hand sanitizer upon arrival, as well as the spritz bottle on the table. We started with some delicious cocktails (park meadows was perfect, loved the gin) and I also tried the sake flight (I personally love nigori). Onto food - they recommend sharing but with covid, we opted to stick with own plates. I had the foie gras rice bowl with chestnuts, daikon, unagi glaze. What an umami bomb! A little pricey but well worth it!']",positive
"[""Ive never been to this place but it does open late night for chinese da laang (small dishes)If you buy more than $25, it comes with plain congee (literally water and rice) which usually pairs with small dishes that are fried/salty.Salt pepper deep fried chicken knee - good portion for the price. Chicken is juicy and the chinese salt-pepper taste was goodSalt pepper deep fried silver (white) fish - very poorly done. Overly fried and the inside of the fish is no longer fish texture but hardened. It is supposed to be chewy but it feels like just deep fried bits.Mapo tofu - not spicy at all. Not even the flavor or spicy bean paste. It has it's own flavor which tastes good but not mapo tofu style sauce.Fried chinese donut - for some reason it didn't come out until we were almost finished with everything. Freshly fried though.So dishes are hit and miss so it depends on what you order."", ""Service is fine - it's a Chinese restaurant run by Chinese ppl. Food is a 3 but because it's so cheap my overall rating is a 4.8 ppl ate 14 dishes to the point of nearly puking and we paid about 20 bucks each. This place is insane. Food was not mind blowing but solid. I'd definitely come here again."", 'We ordered their three course menu set which came with daily soup, rice and \xa0side of hainanese chicken. The three courses that we chose were the radish and brisket, fried salt and pepper shrimp and soy chicken.Over all the flavours were good, and the portions was perfect for our table of four. My only complaint was the radish and brisket came with more radish than brisket, which was no fun at all. The chicken dishes had pretty standard flavours. The soy chicken was better than the hainanese chicken. The salt and pepper shrimp had a nice kick to it, and was fried perfectly crispy on the outside. With over 100 items on the menu, I will definately go back again to try different things.', ""Another day means another trip to sandy la for late night dinner! We absolutely love coming here and it's not a unknown fact that we don't come here.*Pork spareribs with salad dressing ($9.50) ~ don't skip out on this.

Perfectly seasoned with the salt and pepper. Nice kick of heat and super good!*Black bean clams ($10.75) ~ these were huge today! Each one were opened too! The sauce was nice and thick and the perfect amount of black bean flavour.*Singapore vermicelli ($12.75) ~ this lacked some curry powder. The seasoning was good and the filling was mainly on the bottom but overall it could've used more curry flavouring.*Garlic snowtips ($9.25) ~ flavourful and good I like the garlic they added because it adds an extra bit of flavour to it.* 10/10 ~ I mean common I love this place and everyone who has been has enjoyed it too!* 10/10 ~ hella cheap for late night and the portion is pretty good!

And social distanced."", 'Updated rating during covid: We had a reservation at 7pm, had to wait 45 minutes to be seated and then they ended up seating someone else.... Very poor customer service. In addition to only their subpar food, rating has been downgraded to one star.', ""I've been here prior to covid and the food was ok. It's not consistent, but ok.Anyways, I was craving white congee with toppings and this was close to my house. Usually when you order after 930, the food i wanted to order, they give you free white congee. This place doesn't do it for takeout. \xa0We ordered 2 bowls of congee, honey garlic spareribs, black bean green beans with pork, deep fried fish, deep fried squid and black bean clams.CongeeOmg, this was so watery. This was not your typical white congee. This was like a scoop of congee with LOTS of water added...definitely do not recommend, but if you like it like super runny, then get it. I like mines runny too, but not like that..Honey garlic spareribs I guess times are tough and so therefore the spareribs were very little. I've ordered this before and the size different was insane. Taste is ok, but I definitely had better.Black bean green beans with porkThis was ok as well. This had pork in it and my parents kept saying its so soft and was wondering what part is it from. The aroma and flavors for the sauce isn't very strong.Black bean clamsSame sauce so this was ok. We had more shells than actually clams...it is cheap tho..Deep fried squidYou can't go wrong with deep fried food. The squid was great. I wish it had some more flavor in the seasoning, other than that it was crispy and chewy. Probably one of the better dishes we ordered.Deep fried fishAgain, you can't go wrong with deep fried food and again, I wish there was some flavor in the seasoning. Both deep fried dishes lacked flavor (even salt), so I guess it was healthy fried food.Overall, this place is ok, not the best and not the worst. Probably won't order from here until covid is over. Cash only!"", 'Came here for Hong Kong style breakfast. \xa0Food quality is so so. But price is cheap and can upgrade to HK style French toast for free. \xa0HK milk tea was decent as well. Will come back', ""Sandy La is one of the many nondescript Chinese restaurants located in Vancouver... in this particular case, serving the Kensington area around Victoria Drive. The reason why we came to visit this restaurant was because they listed an online special where you order 3 dishes and you get a free order of clams in black bean sauce. We were sad when we arrived at the restaurant and saw that they changed their menu to offer Hainan chicken instead of clams (and the price had gone up).As with many old-school Chinese restaurants, the first thing to arrive at the table was the complimentary soup made with vegetables and some bone-in meat.Despite not offering clams in their special combo anymore, we did wind up ordering the combo where you pick 3 dishes and you get 1/4 Hainan Chicken for $55.95 (you also get rice and dessert with the combo). Hainan (or Hainanese) Chicken is served cold and with a nice dipping sauce (this version was bone-in chicken).The Beef Brisket and Radish Hot Pot was quite large with a plentiful amount of daikon radish (but noticeably fewer pieces of beef brisket). The tender beef brisket was good and had plenty of sauce that's perfect for sopping up with rice.Similarly, the Seafood and Tofu Hot Pot was a generous portion and contained shrimp, fish, and squid along with the tofu.Our third dish was the Chinese Mushroom and Veggies. As with all of the other dishes, the ingredients aren't cut up into bite size pieces (probably to save time). This does make it a bit harder to eat things (especially when you try to take a bite out of a whole Chinese mushroom.Dessert was a Tapioca soup which was not overly sweet.Overall, the food itself was pretty good but the pieces were cut large (which makes it difficult to eat) and there's really nothing which makes this place shine. There is a pretty large menu of items to choose from for the combo dinner but just beware that the items and prices listed online haven't been updated in a while. Note that they are cash only too."", ""Great food at a great price and an amazing local spot. I've been going here for 6 years now and it has never disappointed me. It's always open late for when you're craving late night Chinese food."", ""Was in charge of organizing my family holiday get together and with everyone's busy schedule we were not able to find a date that works until this past Sunday night. In the past, it would take us close to 15 to 30 minutes just deciding what to order so I picked Sandy la as it was close to where everyone lives and they had both an English and Chinese menu online so that all of us can decide on what to order in advance. I made a reservation for all of us (2 tables of 9 each, a total of 18 people).When I \xa0arrived both at 5:30pm both of our tables were ready and the restaurant was already 25% full. My table ordered the 6 dishes combo and selected a lobster as our free dish but added noodles to our lobster for an extra $7. We ordered sweet and sour pork (wasn't great as you could taste that the pork had a slight freezer burn to it), spicy green beans (good but average), fried fish and tofu in hot pot (tasty and good), chicken and shrimp with celery and green peas (a nice light dish with loads of celery and green peas - yum!), beef brisket in curry (average and not hot. Even my 2 year old niece and 5 year old nephew ate it with no issues), and Chinese mushrooms with mustard greens (solid dish). The free lobster also arrived with cream sauce and our added noodles, which was delicious. Only downside was the lobster looked barely to be over 2 lbs although this meant we nearly finished the lobster, for once. Dessert was a black sesame with wild rice soup, which was really nice since most of my family dislike the red bean soup dessert.We left full, with leftovers, and the bill only came to $129 for my table including taxes. There are definitely better restaurants out there but Sandy la wasn't bad especially for the price tag. Not sure if my family will be coming back anytime soon but I'd definitely go back for their late night menu with complimentary plain congee with a minimum $25 spend, which my sister and I have done before.""]",negative
"[""My friend and i finally made it here for lunch today and we were so glad that we did! We had the mixed fried seafood appetizer and it was delicious! We thought it might be bland because it did not come with a sauce but we squeezed a lemon on it and it was delicious. There was plenty of flavor in the batter to Make it delicious. For drinks we had the aperol spritz and St. Teresa specialty drink. The aperol spritz was actually more flavorful than the one we had tried in Italy. The other drink was good as well. For our meals we ordered the tagliatelle with bolognaise sauce and the chittara arrabiata. Both pasta dishes were awesome as well. The portions aren't huge so you don't feel overly stuffed and this left room for one of the best tiramisu I've had in years.

To start off; we asked the host if we could sit outside - she rolled her eyes at us and said ""it\'s full"" even though we had a reservation and it was a Monday night.Then, the waiter walks over to our table and doesn\'t introduce himself or say hello. He looks at one of our party who is pouring water and is annoyed. We tried to ask him for more and he walks away. We ordered simple cocktails and they took 40 minutes to come out. We only asked our waiter once about if they were coming and snapped saying there was a new bartender. I asked the waiter what was in the espresso martini and he said ""a bartender mix"" so I asked him to clarify and he was pissed. I have never had such shitty service in my life. The three pastas, salads, appetizers and desserts that we ordered were overshadowed by the incredibly hostile nature of our waiter.When the bill came, of course tip was already included in the price. I\'m sure that\'s why he didn\'t care about being rude.Would definitely not go back.', ""I came here on a Monday night and there were a decent amount of people, but not quite full. Parking here is kind of hard with the street parking, but I was fine when I parked in the lot with Sephora. The food honestly is just ok. People rave about their cacio e pepe but I thought it was kind of bitter with its aftertaste. The portions are a decent size, but you have to pay for the typical bread and olive oil if you want that. The tiramisu was also ok but it felt like much more cream compared to the cake part.

I got the chitarra arrabbiata, my mom got the bolognese and my boyfriend's mom got the salmon. We all enjoyed our dishes. We ordered tiramisu for dinner and it was good.

"['The husband and I were looking for something a little different on a Saturday afternoon. \xa0Didn\'t have to be crazy but not our usual restaurants. \xa0We realized we hadn\'t been to McCormick and Schmick\'s for awhile and he had always loved the lobster bisque so we thought we\'d give it a shot. \xa0Our last few times were pre-pandemic and it was for the location in Bridgeport Village. \xa0We hadn\'t been to the marina for about 10 years! \xa0We made a lunch reservation and were excited to sit along the water. \xa0This is definitely not the place if you\'re in a wheelchair and want to dine inside. \xa0We parked nearby and my husband wheeled me towards the restaurant. \xa0The main entrance did not look too accessible (small curb and no ramp anywhere in site) so the husband left me outside on the corner while he went to the side entrance to inquire as to the location of the ADA accessible entrance. \xa0They directed him to the main entrance saying that was all they had. \xa0He came to get me and pushed me back to the main entrance, having to pop a wheelie to get me up the curb. \xa0I don\'t know how well an older person who could not move too well or a person in an electric wheelchair would have made it up the curb if they didn\'t have any help. \xa0The manager and host fumbled over themselves as they opened the door saying they hoped to have a ramp or something similar installed within a month or so. \xa0""We\'re planning on a ramp or something next month or so.... a lot of damage happened here during the riots....""I asked them, ""Damage? \xa0What WAS here that got damaged?"" \xa0I didn\'t see any obvious damage of structures, ramps, etc that would help someone get in with a wheelchair. \xa0And besides.. the riots were more than a year ago. \xa0More mumblings of excuses and not really any answers.The food itself was OK. \xa0We ordered baked potato soup which I really liked. \xa0My husband\'s lobster bisque was ok. \xa0I had grilled herb chicken with green beans and mashed potatoes. \xa0Everything was just OK and I felt my chicken was a little dry but that is a common issue with chicken breast. \xa0The husband had scallops and pasta and said while the scallops were overdone, the pasta was too al dente. \xa0It also was not very well-seasoned. \xa0He asked for red pepper flakes, parmesan cheese, and hot sauce. \xa0 Adding these items (plus some of my chicken) made his food a lot more palatable. \xa0We asked our server for dessert recommendations and he told us a fe options but said his favorite was an upside-down apple pie with cinnamon ice cream. \xa0We took his suggestion and loved it. \xa0Sweet, warm, cold, tasty!Overall, I don\'t think we will be back. \xa0The food was OK for the most part and our server was nothing to write home about. \xa0But the lack of accessibility and being made to feel like we were an annoyance did not warm us to this restaurant.', ""Met a few friends for dinner. We started with a couple of appetizers - calamari and shrimp kisses (Pepper Jack Cheese / Bacon Wrapped). We all had various fish dishes - cedar roasted Atlantic salmon, fish & chips, Pacific rockfish, Jameson Irish Whiskey Roasted Salmon (Chef's choice). A good tip is to ask where the fish originated. The roasted Atlantic salmon wasn't farmed salmon like the Chef's choice). Both salmon dishes were cooked to perfection (not dry).

Lackluster for a salad main course. 2, I paid extra for added blackened salmon but it only arrived lightly seasoned vs the nice dark crust (blackened) that I expected.

Lots of great cocktails and desserts too - only wish my stomach were more of a bottomless pit so I could try EVERYTHING.One of the only things stopping me from giving 5 stars: Service / cleanliness could have been better. Someone walked us to our indoor table though we confirmed that we would have an outdoor table in our reservation, and said outdoor reservations were all full for the next month. Curious, but fine, I ignored it - next, we noticed our small plates were still quite dirty with oily remnants on them, so I asked for two new ones. Our waiter took them, apologized because there are apparently some new dishwashers starting out, walked away, and brought them back - turns out all he did was wipe them with a towel, so now they were just oily streaks instead of oily splatters. I didn't say anything further because at this point I could see cleanliness was not a major worry for them - the table we sat at was also quite sticky / oily. All in all, our server was nice but cleanliness is a huge sticking point for me and it also didn't feel great that we couldn't get our original reservation.Overall, the food was good but not mindblowingly amazing - I would recommend for good vibes and happy hour, but maybe not a place for a nice dinner."", ""Warm, vibey spot for elevated Southern favorites!

Also tried some of the blackened redfish and slow cooked beef shoulder, and everything was executed well.The desserts may well have been my favorite part of the meal - both the chocolate truffle cake and bananas foster beignets (!) were addictingly decadent. Sadly, I was way too full from some good heavy Southern cooking and a pair of cocktails to really dig in.The one big knock against Salty Sow was that they enforced a somewhat bizarrely high table minimum on our party. We weren't in a private room or anything like that - in fact, we were seated at a long bench/picnic table style high top in the outdoor back patio, nearby several other tables. I think the minimum they told us was something like $60 per person?

The sauce was seasoned well and was applied generously and evenly without being sloppy or soggy. If you generally order extra sauce at a pizza joint, I personally don't see the need here, but that's just my opinion. The cheese and pepperoni were, like the sauce, also generously applied. The cheese was very nice and melted very nicely and still had a creamy texture to it. The pepperoni was just spicy enough. Nothing overboard that would mask the other flavors and by no means bland either. This pie was put together very well. If you enjoy subs, they won't disappoint here either. The bun has sesame seeds on top and is toasted nicely. The meat was generous without becoming overwhelming, as with the tomato, lettuce, onion, peppers and cheese. All-in-all, a good, even balance of the meat and toppings. The dressing is on the side, which is always a plus for me. With the dressing on the side, it prevents the sub from becoming soggy and maintain its toasty crunch. It also lets you decide how much dressing to add to your sub.

You don't need a reservation to eat at the bar as the rest of the restaurant seemed packed for dinner. All I can say is best steak blue cheese salad I've ever had.

We had the carbonara gnocchi, bbq pork chop, and the chicken sandwich. All were raved about I especially liked the wasabi cheese potatoes with the very good pork chop.

The drunken shrimp, and the tomato bruschetta were great appetizers. I also had to have the rhubarb wine which makes the meal special.']",positive

The steak was MASSIVE and professionally seasoned. Did not like that the side lettuce/tomatoes were so minuscule in comparison to the amount of protein provided. We also had asked for extra tortillas about 4 times and didn't receive them until we left, which is why I'm rating the service 3/5.

While I totally enjoyed my first visit (5 stars), the second visit wasn't that great. This would be a 5 star review otherwise..On our first visit we were seated in the section on the top and were served by Courtland. If you do visit, ask to be seated in his section. He is attentive, helpful, courteous and genuinely wants to see everyone happy. We had our 2 year old with us, and he made sure to ask us a 1000 times if there was anything else we wanted to make him comfortable!On our second visit (Wednesday evening), we were 1. Called out for being 20 mins late after putting our name on the waitlist. The place was half empty - so that was uncalled for.2. When we were given a booth right next to the door and we asked for another table, the hostess made a face and told us there would be a wait since they were busy. Really with 6 tables empty in front of us?3. After we were seated our server was very rushed - didn't ask us if we wanted drinks (just because we had our kid with us doesn't mean we will not drink), was in a rush to get us to order, once the food came didn't check in, and finally did not offer us any dessert - maybe she thought we had eaten enough?Now for the food and drinks - top notch! Drinks: Got the OG marg, the blood orange marg and The Frida (Mezcal marg). All were made perfect, with a nice kick to it.. I love it when I taste the booze rather than only the other misc ingredients.Food: We enjoyed the house chips and salsas (avocado tomatillo salsa and a tomato salsa). My favorite was the avocado tomatillo salsa. Really flavorful and frankly went better with the chips. We also ordered the guac. It was fresh, mildly seasoned (read appropriate salt and citrus) and had a good amount of cilantro (cilantro lover here) accompanied by some fried tostadas. For my meal, I got the Tacos DE Camarones - gulf shrimp, slaw, and a very hot Chile mayo sauce. My suggestion is that you should ask for the sauce on the side. I also got the Tacos DE Barbacoa - melt in your mouth brisket. I couldn't be happier!! I also tried the Chicken and Steak tacos on my first visit.Feel free to mix and match. The rice and refried beans were good to get my belly quite full!!Overall, I will be back here because I like the vibe, and the food and drinks are great. I will let the service issues slide and hope they are a one off but to be sure, next time I will remember to get seated where Courtland can serve us!!Parking is always a pain so plan ahead and be ready to circle the lot a few times if necessary. If you need to wait, they have a small waiting area and you can grab a drink while you wait. Also the process with the waitlist is that you have to show up in the time window that is given to you - only then are you put on another list to be seated. Too many lists here but this is useful information. I would encourage the restaurant to optimize this process - reservations maybe or just one list - add your name, get called when you are ready to be seated?"", ""I have a soft spot in my heart for superica. I really love their salad with shrimp on it. I know that is the most boring thing to possibly order here, but I am not joking... It's the best.I also really love their queso fundido with flour tortillas. I am allergic to corn and carrots, so eating at Mexican places is a little bit hard for me. The chorizo that they use in the queso fundido definitely does have carrots in it. When I am drinking, I really do love superica's basic margarita. However, when I am not drinking I love that they also serve topo Chico!"", ""I have heard many Atlanta locals rave about this spot and had to check it out. We went on a calm day so it was nice because usually walking by Krog, this spot is extremely busy. The one thing I didn't really like was that- where we were seated was extremely dark.

I loved how the patio was set up and was eager to order. Of course, we ordered queso and margaritas to start and our entrees were a combination of tacos.

Entering the cafe it\'s very ""hipster""-y and warm and feels like the kind of place you could easily spend an afternoon catching up and drinking tea with friends. We ordered the pesto spaghetti with mushrooms (as recommended by the staff) and patiently waited for it to arrive. Not a vegan myself, I was kind of dreading what the food was going to taste like and how un-filling it was going to be.... and I was pleasantly surprised by the portions (look at that plate size!) It was light and creamy but a little on the watery side because of the liquid coming out from the zucchini. I liked the nutty sauce they used and felt it complimented the noodles well. I was full quite quickly and wasn\'t able to finish... however later on in the afternoon I was hungry again :\'D Food was alright, but at $17 for pasta I would prefer to eat elsewhere for something I really crave.', 'This place was good.

The wrap was okay, but man I was quite surprised and dissappointed about the size of the meal. I could have finished the wrap in 6 bites if I really tried and the salad in 2 bites. I have been to other veggie wrap places in the area such as the caveman cafe, and they serve very tasty and larger wraps for a lower price. One thing that I did like about their meal were the bean sprouts. I feel like they should have snazzed up their salad with more of them and more strongly advertised as the feature of the dish. Those sprouts were good.Overall, a bit bummed at the bit of bite I got. I\'d probably come here again if I was asked nicely, but I wouldn\'t recommend cause of small portion sizes and out of stock appetizers.Just also looked at the other pictures of items on the menu \xa0and they look better than what I got.

We've had afternoon tea at more than ten different places now so I guess we had certain expectations that Indigo did not meet. There are two things that I look forward to with afternoon tea: the scones and the atmosphere. The afternoon tea here does not come with scones. The food was all just okay. Most savoury ones were too salty, and it didn't feel like the ingredients fit together very well in terms of flavours. I really felt like I was eating a salad in small chunks. As for the atmosphere, I would call it rustic hippie. There is no elegance or Victorian vibe in this setting. \xa0The tables are really close together, and the waitress bumped our table while trying to get to another, shaking the entire tower while we were eating. Not really her fault because the space is so tight. I wouldn't mind coming here again for a takeout meal, but definitely not for the afternoon tea."", 'Feels very zen. My wrap tasted good.

It is not, but no big deal they still have okay vegan options. I'll start by saying that this place is super small, the seating arrangement is a bit awkward and the tables are wobbly. We sat down only to be escorted to a smaller table promptly because there wasn't much room.We tried a few items on the menu: started with the mini burgers which are made with a sunflower seed patty, followed by the kelp salad and lastly the cabbage rolls. The food came out quickly, but the only thing we liked was the kelp salad. The mini burgers were okay but way too salty, the cabbage rolls were soggy and flavourless. These rolls were soaked in some sort of tomato sauce that didn't look like the cabbage rolls other people posted -they were also tough to eat. This was our first time trying Ukrainian food so maybe that was part of the reason why these flavours didn't appeal to us.

Calamari came on a bed of fries vermicelli noodles...no sauce, but a wedge of lime came with it. Was salty and just ok. The lobster bisque was good, tasted the lobster, but nothing great.

The seafood pasta was good, the noodles were cooked well, good variety of seafood, mussels, salmon, scallops and the sauce was not too creamy For dessert we ordered the lava cake and creme brulet. When it was time for dessert we were told that the lava cake is for two so we were only able to get either one lava cake or two of something else...hmmm...not sure why we couldn't have both...but the lava cake was the best part of the meal. For the price I was pretty disappointed..we ended up paying close to 190 including tip, and it wasn't even close to matching up to other restaurants that charge this much.

The service was pretty good, our waiting staff actually really impressed me, because there were many orders and the orders were taken with no mistake as I recall. The food itself was a bit on the pricey side, but was of good quality and flavourful. While we were enjoying our meal, a little rat/big mouse was climbing the curtains. We mentioned it to the staff who quickly went to get a manager, but nothing could be done. We were told that the restaurant was on a barge, and that rodents often live on barges.

I ordered the sesame crusted tuna, which comes with mushrooms and rice. The tuna was cooked decently, but lacked a real sear on the outside. You could also tell that it just wasn't fresh. It had a semi-muddy texture indicative of either a poor quality fish or fish that just isn't fresh. My portion was SMALL for $30. The rice was overcooked and veggies basically non-existent. I didn't ask around about anyone's food....it just wasn't the time or place....but the other three portions were also tiny. Having just had lunch at Cardero's and dinner at Chambar in the past week, this was a MAJOR step down. In fact, I will never visit any of the Boathouse locations again.

It was one of the best I have had.I wish it had a bit more andouille sausage in it (it only had 5 or 6 little pieces), but that's ok.For dessert I had the key lime tart...which definitely had me coming back for more.I would highly recommend this restaurant."", ""With so many reservation required dining restaurants in all of Disney parks, it's hard to choose sometimes. \xa0I would have loved to have one of the character dining but since it's during the pandemic, a lot of those are not available. \xa0Therefore, I was looking for something that had a unique view and kid friendly menu.This is located in the Future World near The Seas with Nemo & Friends. \xa0The restaurant has a great aquarium view of the sea creatures. \xa0We went on the Nemo ride before coming to the restaurant for a late lunch.My dish was the Seared Sustainable Salmon while my daughter had the Grilled Chicken with Sweet Soy Sauce. \xa0My Seared Sustainable Salmon was delicious. \xa0It had a nice crispy skin with a crunch and paired very well with the seasoned risotto and salad. \xa0The grilled chicken did seem less luster but I'm glad that they didn't douse the sauce all over. \xa0My daughter was very happy she got to dip the sauce.At the end, we completed the meal with Chocolate Wave. \xa0It was a perfect dessert, as it's not too sweet nor too rich."", ""My daughter and I visited Coral Reef a few years ago and loved it. We went back to celebrate my birthday a few days ago and my hubby joined us. I love the atmosphere at Coral Reef. We had a great seat look directly at the aquarium. This is a family friendly restaurant. It wasn't noisy. Since it's at EPCOT, no one is dressed up. Come as your are. Now, let's talk about the food. I ordered the shrimp and grits. It was delicious. I was scrapping the bowl. There were plenty of shrimp. I had a piece of shrimp with every bite. My husband and daughter ordered the prime rib. My daughter enjoyed her prime rib, but my husband did not like his. He said it had no flavor. The cake my daughter ordered was absolutely cute and delicious. It was a milk chocolate cake. It was so good. She ordered it through Disney. We made reservations, but got there early. They took us to our table immediately. I love this place. We will visit again when we are at Disney. Give it a try!"", ""This place might be the best dining choice at Epcot. \xa0First of all, it would be best to make a reservation ahead of time. \xa0However, if you didn't happen to make a reservation, don't give up, you can always get a chance by walking in if you are lucky.The most amazing thing about the restaurant is how you can dine with a big aquarium right in front of your eyes.Mahi-Mahi is pretty good. \xa0 Their steak is decent as well. \xa0The lobster bisque is a little bit on the salty side and the same goes for most of their food.However, nothing beats dining with appreciating the amazing aquarium view so I didn't have high expectations of the food.It is definitely a great experience dining there along with the fact that Epcot is amazing itself."", ""I went to the Coral Reef for the first time on my most recent vacation. This is absolutely a restaurant you go to for the atmosphere. We were seated next to the aquarium tank and it was a great experience. The grilled rib eye steak and the salmon were both pretty good - nothing really special. The Blood Orange Margarita was tart and delicious. Honestly, the complimentary dessert we received since we were celebrating was probably the best bite of the meal. The main draw is the aquarium and if I hadn't been right next to it I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much. If someone asked to go back to Coral Reef I would, but I won't be picking it for an upcoming vacation reservation anytime soon.""]",negative
"[""Loved both the restaurant and the lounge area. Great atmosphere. Staff and owner were really nice. The only reason they did not get a 5 is only because they didn't have 2/3 of the drinks I wanted. The lounge Area and appetizer menu was ok but nothing spectacular. Overall, I would go again."", 'I came here several years ago while visiting my best friend for his bachelor party. When I lived in Atlanta 8 years ago there were no hookah bars so it was cool to visit one. The service and food were okay. It was a busy Saturday night and this is a great location near I-85.', 'Food Therapy is a Mediterranean restaurant and hookah lounge that opened Spring 2013 in a strip mall near the intersection of Clairmont and Briarcliff Roads, not far from I-85. \xa0It\'s the sister restaurant/lounge to Therapy Coffee Bar & Lounge (a.k.a. ""Therapy Lounge""), which is in the same building, opposite side.Both Therapy Lounge and Food Therapy have hookah service. \xa0The main difference between the two businesses is Food Therapy is more of a restaurant. \xa0Hookah service at Food Therapy doesn\'t begin until after dinner service. \xa0The thought behind that is customers dining, especially those with kids, won\'t be put off or disturbed by the hookah smoke.I visited Food Therapy to smoke hookah and celebrate a friend\'s birthday. \xa0This was after dinner at a separate venue, so we didn\'t try any of the foods except for dessert. \xa0I think the original idea was to go to Therapy Lounge and smoke hookah there, but the lounge was too busy to accommodate our large group, so they sent us over to Food Therapy instead.It was a Saturday night and there were about 15 of us total. \xa0Food Therapy was able to handle us easily because we were the some of the only customers for most of the late night (10pm to close -- after midnight).The atmosphere is relaxed, laid back, and casual. \xa0At night, the interior is dim and candle-lit. \xa0There is sort of an exotic Mediterranean/Middle Eastern theme going on with ornately decorated chairs and fabrics. \xa0There\'s limited outdoor seating on the sidewalk outside, which seems to be a popular option when the weather is nice.I haven\'t smoked hookah at *too* many places in Atlanta. \xa0House of Hookah near Atlantic Station and Laziza at Marietta Square come to mind. \xa0In comparison, Food Therapy seems to have the cleanest and mildest hookah I\'ve smoked anywhere in the Atlanta area.There are three different tiers of hookah flavors. \xa0They range in price from $15, $18, and $22 each. \xa0Refills for the aforementioned hookahs are $7, $9, and $11, respectively.I tried three different flavors from the $18 tier. \xa0They were called Melon Blue, Pirate\'s Cove, and Blue Mist. \xa0I\'m no connoisseur when it comes to hookah, but I found the flavors to be quite subtle. \xa0I did enjoy the Melon Blue and Blue Mist. \xa0They were light and refreshing. \xa0Pirate\'s Cove... not so much.I find the hookah tobacco here to be less intense than others I\'ve tried. \xa0I hardly felt a buzz, if any at all. \xa0The smell of the smoke didn\'t linger in my mouth as an unpleasant aftertaste nor did I leave Food Therapy smelling like hookah smoke. \xa0I guess that\'s a good thing. \xa0I\'ve run into problems with hookahs at other places, but the staff seems to get the hookahs here up and running without any issue.Water isn\'t free. \xa0Maybe with food, but not with hookah. \xa0They force you to purchase bottled water, which is a rip-off.Service was good. \xa0The staff was friendly and attentive. \xa0One gripe I have is they wouldn\'t split our table\'s check evenly. \xa0I\'ve been to plenty of restaurants where bills are split evenly among large groups without a problem, so I\'m not sure what the issue was here other than the employee not wanting to manually swipe multiple cards.', ""Went to Food therapy last month on a Friday night! (This is a Late post)! This was my first time at Food Therapy! \xa0Fonta was our waitress and she was very friendly and quite knowledgeable on the menu. The setting and ambience was chill and relaxing just like a lounge should be. Food: we tried different dishes so we could share and trust me the portions are shareable. We ordered a Lamb burger with Greek fries, the Daviola Shrimp Pasta, and the new Goat dish ( which didn't have a name at that time). Heads up in the Daviola shrimp pasta, it is HOT HOT HOT!!! But So worth it. Goat is not easy to cook and I give my compliments to the chef for his dish was \xa0 perfectly cooked. It was nice and tender with the right amount of seasoning. The prices are decent but we did splurge quite a bit and it was worth it!Drinks and Hookah: we tried a Moscow Mule of which I thought was a bit watered down hence the 4 rating I gave. Second round we decided on the Ginger Mojito which was a bit too sweet. Their drinks are also a bit pricey but the hookah I really liked. Its also wise to avoid overeating before hookah. Overall for my first time at Food therapy, I had a great time and even got to meet the owner, Simone, a very laid back, wonderful guy!"", ""Nuts and bolts: A friend suggested this for a group lunch. Order: This review is based on the buffet which I hear changes day by day. My friend liked the food on her first visit. Unfortunately, the buffet menu was quite different than when she returned. I don't recall a number of the items on the menu. But I remember it being not ver Mediterranean in nature. I was very confused when I looked at it. There was some meatloaf that I tried, some fish, and some rice. I also tried some veggies, but I can't recall what exact veggies they were.Verdict: My main issue was that it wasn't what I was picturing for a \xa0Mediterranean buffet. So I felt a bit misled. The rice was bland. The meatloaf was weird. The fish was just OK. Nice atmosphere though! I see it being a nice place for an intimate, romantic dinner. Take home message: I might need to try this place out for dinner."", ""From the start, our server was very rude and not warming. \xa0She got our drinks wrong and had an attitude! \xa0One thing about me....i don't play about customer service. \xa0I spoke to the manager and she got our drink order correct. \xa0About an hour later we were told that their credit card system was not working and we had to go across the street to use the Quick Trip ATM (which charges a fee) to take money out to pay for our drinks/food. \xa0Come on!!!!!!! \xa0Such an inconvenience... Hookah was decent that's about it. \xa0I'll pass on coming here again."", ""I came here for the lounge portion, not the restaurant. So I can't comment on the food. At night, when Therapy Lounge gets too packed, it spills over to Food Therapy. The music isn't as loud or happening as Therapy Lounge. This place feels more chill. I guess it still has that restaurant vibe.The place is small though. But there are seats inside and outside. Their hookahs were hookahs you can get anywhere else. The flavors seem more subtle though. The flavor of the hookah comes near the end instead of hitting you all over when you inhale. The service was friendly and fast. I don't drink so I can't comment on their drinks. So I guess this review was pretty worthless. I had fun here with my friends so I'm going to give it 4 stars. If you're looking for a chill place to smoke hookah, drink, and hang out check this place out."", ""Thank you ScoutMob for introducing us to this fantastic restaurant!My boyfriend and I were craving mediterranean food and thought Food Therapy was the perfect restaurant to visit. \xa0The first thing you notice when you walk in is the beautiful decor. The owner did a wonderful job of creating a warm, inviting space that is perfect for small group get togethers and dinner dates.The menu is simple and easy to read. There are plenty of tasty options and we were told that they would be expanding the menu later in the year. \xa0They also offer a full bar as well so if you're craving a dirty martini, they've got you covered.We loved everything we ordered off the menu. Everything from the chicken skewers to the grilled salmon were delicious! My favorite menu item was their beef tips. Typically at the local Ethiopian eats, they tend to over cook the beef tips but Food Therapy's version was hard to resist. The meat was well cooked and every bite was so tender and flavorful. I was a fan of the tomatoes that were a huge part of this dish so if you're not a fan, do not order this dish.After leaving the restaurant that night, it was already determined that we will certainly return for more! I highly recommend that you pay Food Therapy a visit if you're near the Briarcliff Rd./ Clairmont Rd area.

I was craving fried chicken and knew this was the spot to come to after having a good experience here three years ago. I can say we didn't have the same experience this time around. The fried chicken had a great crunchy coating, but it lacked flavor and was very dry. The biscuit was also dry and unappetizing. The mac & cheese, however, was creamy and cheesy... all that you hope for in such a meal. Our waitress was friendly enough. Disappointingly, I felt underwhelmed by the whole experience considering the price point."", ""Hen Quarter brunch has the potential to be great, but it still falls a little short. My friend and I made a reservation for a Sunday brunch, courtesy of open table. No issues with the reservation and we were shown to our table as soon as we arrived. We were seated on the patio which has been screened in, covered and heated for the winter. However the heat was on way too high. Normally I run cold and it was snowing outside, but it had to be 85 degrees in there and I was seating in my dress the entire meal. \xa0The biggest improvement needed is service, we rarely saw our waitress, when she did stop by our table it was usually to tell us they were out of whatever we had just ordered. I wish all the restaurants in Bridge Park would just take the Peach Bellini off their menu because every single one of them is out of the ingredients every time I try to order it. \xa0I'm not sure what other section our waitress was assigned, but she was clearly running around the restaurant to her tables. I ordered the chicken and waffles and the entree was huge! Plenty to bring home for a second meal. It was pretty good, if a little bland, but I would order it again. I would give Hen Quarter a redo on brunch because I think they can do better. Right now I would book other restaurants in the area for brunch instead though."", ""Cute restaurant in the heart of bridge park. Our waitress was really sweet.

We went here for my mother's 44th birthday and this also so happened to be jazz night. So there was live jazz while we sat and enjoyed our dinner. We started our dinner off with a few different appetizers one being the southern crab jar which I've seen a lot on the internet so I was excited to try this. The taste of the buttery, king crab was very good however $58 for this tiny jar of crab and butter was just insane to me, especially since it's nothing to be overly excited about. We also tried the devil eggs, and cornbread. The cornbread was nice and sweet and the butter was nice and smooth. The devil eggs were way to tiny but they were ok. Now we're on to the entrees we each rated our entrees I had a bite of of everyone's entree and I can say tjw"", 'Met several girlfriends for a late brunch on a Saturday. There was live jazz, which was nice but the music made it very hard to hear conversation. We ordered several small plates to share and several bottles for mimosas. The lobster dip was my favorite.

I like the location and plenty of parking options nearby.', ""Hen Quarter is a solid option if you find yourself in the new downtown Dublin area looking for a good meal. I ended up here with a few friends a couple weekends ago, and overall we had a positive experience.We sat at the outdoor patio, and our waitress was helpful and attentive. I tried the short rib and my friend tried the lobster roll. Both were delicious and flavorful, and we had a wonderful time sitting outside, sipping cocktails, people watching, and enjoying our meals. Ultimately a major factor for me when reviewing an establishment on Yelp is value for the price, and I did feel like Hen Quarter was a bit lacking in this department. The food was delicious, but you're paying for the location and the trendy atmosphere, and at the end of the day the service and the food didn't knock our socks off for the price.I'm sure Hen Quarter will have a lot of success due to the area and how popular it's becoming. Definitely worth a shot if you're in the area and willing to spend a little more for a quality meal!"", 'Suggested by a friend to come here for our 31st anniversary. Fried chicken and green beans were great as well as the crab cakes. Asked my wife if she would come back and we agreed maybe or maybe not. A little pricey compared to other venues for what you get. Plus they asked if we were celebrating anything special and I said yes, our anniversary. Really no mention of it or anything. Not sure why they asked? $24 for fried chicken, $34 for crab cakes and $14 for fried cauliflower.

We had a party of about 8. The service was excellent!

The drinks were *chef\'s kiss* perfect. The crab stuffed salmon, short rib, mac & cheese, and the gumbo were reported to be delicious (I didn\'t try the salmon or gumbo.) I personally didn\'t like the mac & cheese. It didn\'t give me the ""home cooked"" feel I was hoping for. It tastes store-bought, like Costco\'s brand. The fried chicken was a big miss. I ordered all wings. All I tasted was unseasoned, thick breading. The breading was too much, and greasy. The biscuit was hard. Also, if you specify the part of the chicken you want for your order (like all wings), it\'s an additional $8, FYI. The garlic green beans were very garlicky--and delicious! I love garlic, so keep that in mind. Overall, the service, music, drinks, and ambiance were awesome. The food was decent, but not a home run. I still recommend this place to try as there\'s plenty of items to check out on the menu.', ""This place is great for brunch. Making reservations online was easy. I went on a Saturday for brunch with friends. It can be pretty crowded, but it was perfect with the reservation. They had live jazz music playing, which was perfect. Just beware that parking can be a bit more difficult as the Dublin Farmer's Market is on Saturdays as some of the roads are closed off for that. Next time, I will head there earlier to shop at the market. Everything was delicious. I ordered the chicken and waffles and the hurricane mocktail. It was such a pretty drink. The chicken was cooked perfectly and was super crispy. There was not enough heat or syrup on the waffle for me, so I asked for syrup and hot sauce on the side which perfected the meal. It is 3 large pieces of chicken over a huge waffle. I was not able to finish it, but it was delicious. We all ordered the lobster dip and cornbread to share. The order is big enough to feed a group. Both appetizers were delicious. The friends who got the lobster benedict and next lifetime mocktail also raved about the taste. The ambiance and food is great here. The server was nice and checked on us throughout the meal. 20% gratuity was added to our bills as we were a group of 7. Will go back again.""]",positive

Actually we were really struggling by the end. The portions here are a little bit bigger than standard, so I'd say order double the number of dishes as you have people, maybe a little bit more. For the 4 of us, 8-9 dishes would've been perfect.My favorite dish was tofu with soft boiled egg. I've never seen this dish before, but my friend told me it's one of their signature dishes. All the standard dimsum dishes we ordered were also good, with the exception of the steamed chicken feet. I was disappointed by this dish, as the meat stuck too closely to the bone instead of being puffier. One member of our party was vegetarian, and there was a good number of vegetarian options on the menu for him. The only one I didn't like was the vegetarian goose, which was made of mushroom and served cold. I personally prefer hot dishes, especially at dimsum.There is a parking garage right next to the restaurant where we found a spot for free pretty easily on the 3rd level."", 'We had dimsum here on New Years Day.

Only complaint was that we couldn\'t taste the truffle, but after eating the har gow detailed below, it\'s possible we consumed these while still too hot. A solid 4 stars.Shrimp spring rolls: simple (no added seaweed, mushrooms, or tempura) but perfectly executed: flavourful (garlicky), fresh prawns bursting with flavour, and a crispy, crunchy shell that doesn\'t taste oily. 4.75 stars.Har gow (shrimp dumplings): the same juicy, flavourful prawns. The skin (rice roll) has excellent texture and thickness; however, when they\'re piping hot, you can\'t taste the skin at all. Let them cool down slightly (but not too long, as it then adversely affects the flavour of the prawns). 4.5 stars.Chiu Chow fun goh (pork & raddish dumpling) I am not a connoisseur of, so I can\'t say how these stack up against others, but the wife says 4.5 stars. Pretty good, for me 3.75-4 stars, but again she eats this frequently, not me.Cha siu bao: too bready. 2.75 stars. Wouldn\'t order again. Aesthetically pleasing, nice ""pinapple bun"" crust on top, and even the filling is good, but much too little of it. Primarily spongy bread.Beef balls: large, well cooked (steamed), flavourful. 5 stars. Didnt expect these to steal the show.The tea is $1.50/ person (slightly higher than average) but the tea is also better, more intense. The bill for 6 dishes came to $42.00 before tax; very reasonable (with prices ranging from $5.95 to $6.45, slughtly below average dim sum prices here).It\'s a very solid 4.25 stars, 8.6/10.

The to-go prepared foods that I\'ve seen have been ridiculously overpriced in my opinion. $18 for servings of green beans, brussel sprouts and Mac and cheese that might feed 2 people is a bit much. I\'ve always seen lines at the the counter for prepared foods though, so I\'m assuming the food is good. I\'ve tried a lemon cake from them was a bit on the dry side, but a cookie that I tried was pretty good. I\'ve always received good customer service from the staff.

Like bread, condiments, veggies, cold cuts, poultry, beer, pork, and seafood. \xa0The staff in there is always so kind and friendly!!"", ""Today was the first time in over two and a half years since I've visited Oak Grove Market, and a lot of things have changed during the time I was gone.Oak Grove Market is in a small strip mall in Decatur. \xa0I've only been here on Saturday mornings, and parking in the free parking lot has always been available.Oak Grove Market's employees all wear face masks, and customers are required to wear face masks. \xa0The employees are friendly, quick, efficient and provide excellent customer service. \xa0This business always had a Mom and Pop feel, but now it also has a Mom and Pop look. \xa0There is no longer indoor dining allowed. \xa0All of the tables have been removed from the middle of the store and were replaced by racks of packaged food items. \xa0Oak Grove Market has different sections: a fresh meat department, fresh seafood department, deli department including cold salads and deli meats, and a hot food bar that is available during breakfast and lunch hours. \xa0Refrigerated items are along one of the walls. \xa0There are some tables out front to eat at when the weather is nice.The main reason why I like this place is because of the breakfast menu at the hot food bar. \xa0My favorite item is the breakfast burrito. \xa0The employee at the hot food bar pressed a big flour tortilla in the grill and got the tortilla hot enough to melt a slice of cheese on it. \xa0While this is happened, he hand chopped strips of cooked bacon. \xa0He then piled scrambled eggs onto the burrito and placed the chopped bacon on top of the egg, and then rolled everything tightly with the tortilla and cut it in half before wrapping it in paper, and placing it and a generous amount of salsa into a plastic cup into a take out container. \xa0The breakfast burrito is fully packed with food and is so delicious. \xa0We were going to eat our burritos at home, but, instead, ate it in the car because I wanted to eat the food while it was still hot ... not to mention that I was starving already. \xa0I savored the burrito the entire time I was eating. \xa0The salsa added a nice salted spiciness that enhanced the burrito's flavor even more. \xa0I was full when I finished off the burrito. \xa0I could probably eat one of these burritos every day because they're so good!Reasonable prices, friendly and efficient employees and great tasting breakfast burritos made this morning's experience memorable! \xa0I have to come back more often."", ""Food is just ok.

They have yummy onion rings and other sides to go with your sandwich. They also make tasty sandwiches made with Boar's head meats and cheeses. OGM also makes pre-made take and go dinners as well as sides like potato salad, shrimp salad and more. Back in the day this place used to have a slushee machine but I think it's no longer there.

It's pretty basic, a real old-town local market feel. I have had the lunch special (salmon+1 side) and the Reuben sandwich. Portions were large and satisfying. Basic Coca Cola cups and plastic plates/silverware. You order at the counter and pay once you leave. The sweet tea is the perfect level of sweet, and the ice is soft and crunchy. They also have an assortment of other features including a meat market, an ice cream counter (only $2.00 per two scoops), and a fruit and veggie stand. They have a pre-prepared food section where you can pick up lasagna and other items which you can pop into the stove at home. My parents live with walking distance from this place and it has become a staple in our life. I look forward to stopping by for a meal when I'm visiting from Augusta. Awesome all around! Prices are affordable!"", ""I almost don't want to give OGM 5 stars because I want it to stay a local neighborhood favorite.. T_T I moved into the area earlier in 2018 and always pass this plaza on my commute. One Saturday afternoon, we stopped by to check it out, and then it changed our lives. Now I try to stop by every Saturday for their chicken nachos..those days are my favorite Saturdays. Food -- I've had a breakfast platter (~$5) that comes with choice of bacon or sausage, eggs, grits and biscuit, a brisket plate (~$11), shrimp and grits ($11-12??) and their chicken nachos ($7.99). And... I recommend it all! I have to slowly try more menu items. I will say that I noticed the chicken nachos taste better around noon or later. It's actually ready around 10:15ish but the cheese sauce needs time to thicken. It seems a lot soupier before noon. Ambience and service -- it's always packed here on the weekends! Not so much in the morning, but lunchtime is super busy. It's a market-style dining, \xa0it's also very small with some outside seating available. On super busy days, parking can be a challenge. But I've always had a good experience with the people behind the counters. When they know I'm waiting, they try to get my order ready as quickly as they can and then come around to personally give me my order when they're not busy.""]",positive

The prices were extremely feasible and there is garage parking that is free for 3 hours. Me and my friend went on a weekday lunch hour. There was literally no one in the restaurant.

He was very aggressive, every time I spoke he'd cut me off. When I told him to not interrupt me he literally put the phone down and kept me on hold for ten minutes until I hung up and called again. Then he picked up immediately, and as soon as he recognized my voice and I asked for his name, he hung up on me again. I called back again and a new person immediately picked up and said his name was Wilson, but they may be covering.Jin's Fine Asian Cuisine should really be changed to Jin's Fast Asian Cuisine. And the prices should reflect that. The dumplings were so obviously microwaved, my dinner companion remarked they could have made them better at home.

Even though they're in Brookline, the delivery is consistently on time - even when I ordered for Christmas Eve!Although Jin's serves a number of Asian cuisines, our favorites are the American-Chinese and Szechuan options. Pork Fried Rice, steamed soup dumplings, and chicken fingers are always spectacular. They also do a great udon and a great pad thai. The chicken and garlic clay hot pot is stupid delicious and all the Szechuan specials remind me of a lot of the food I ate when I lived in China for a summer. Spicy dry pot with beef vegetable, spicy cumin beef, diced chicken with chili pepper, sole filets with napa cabbage, and the sautéed Chinese cabbage are all delicious and authentic (and spicy!), you can't go wrong. While we've tried their sushi a few times, there are other spots I like a bit more. Certainly still good sushi, just not my favorite in Boston.

Why I'm pointing this out is Bc all of their food tastes good except for anything not related to Chinese like the pad Thai I got as well as the sushi - both tasted good but not better than a traditional Japanese or Thai place. Their bar seatings are always empty, likely due to the type of customers they get. It's very quiet and old people vibes lol. We were watching the football game at the bar (with zero volume) and it felt uncomfortable to cheer on a team. Nonetheless, this place is very cute and clean.

When I tasted the pizza, I was sorely disappointed. The crust was tasteless and porous; a thin layer of sauce had absorbed into it, leaving behind the mere appearance of sauce. A scattering of fresh mozzarella was not enough to offset the overwhelming blandness of it all.

Ordering took about 7 minutes because the employee, though friendly, didn't seem to know what options were available and we had to talk through what I could get instead. Finally I was told I could customize the margherita pizza, and chicken would be extra. I ordered a margherita pizza with chicken, mushrooms and spinach added for in store pickup.

The margherita sauce was bland and unappealing, and the whole thing was undersalted and underseasoned - no salt, pepper, etc. The crust was the only part I enjoyed - and I am far from a pizza snob. Overall very underwhelming. A restaurant whose focus is pizza should have more than two options a day. I want to support Dudley Dough, but they need to expand their options, streamline their web and in-store offerings, be better prepared for telephone orders, and improve the pizza taste."", 'Oh my goodness!

"[""I can't believe that it took 4 years of living in Boston to make it to Kupels! I'm from Westchester, NY originally, so I have low expectations of bagels made more than 50 miles away from New York. These bagels hit the spot and were indistinguishable from ones I've eaten in NY.I went to Kupels on a Saturday morning around 10:30am. It was busy, but not packed. I ordered a Brookline Village (smoked salmon, tomato, red onions, and cream cheese) on an everything bagel, a coffee, a pumpernickel bagel, a sesame bagel, and an apricot hamentashcen. The cashier was really nice and patient as I made my decision. There were a few picnic tables outside and a couple seats inside at the window (bar-style seating), but I decided to take my food to go.The sandwich was filled generously with all the accoutrements. The coffee was just alright. The bagels were all big and puffy, not thin. The hamentaschen was good. There are tons of pastries to choose from, so I would probably go with something different next time. Overall, Kupel's has great food and staff are friendly. I can't wait to come back here!"", 'We had a craving for some lox and bagels and we have never tried Kupels. We ordered two of them in the morning and I could get better bagels at Star Market. The bagels were stale, cold, and flavorless. We wasted $25 and woke up extra early to avoid Sunday crowds.', 'If you are craving New York Bagels... THE FOODI ordered one of their favorite bagels ""Lechmere"" with onion bagel. It tastes better than I expected maybe because I was coming in with low expectations. The only downside is pretty expensive when you want to add things. I like the lox is missing that capers but it was just expensive adding that alone so I didn\'t feel like it. They have lots of different bagels as well on-site that you can buy I also ordered their chocolate danish. It was good. I love the number of choc chips. When you have a bite, you can taste choc but also like a tiny orange flavored. I don\'t know why this is the case but it does and I don\'t think the description mentioned anything about orange. THE PLACEIt is super small inside. It seems like a family business which I like. If you are more of the type of person who likes to see what they eat, you will see a bakery stand with lots of petite sweet and sour bakeries there. THE SERVICEI ordered through Ubereats so not sure what the service is. It is a busy place though!OTHERIf you are from the area, parking is tricky. There is a small parking lot nearby but it is usually packed as well. Sunday would be the best to come since you can park pretty much everywhere and come around noon instead of morning. OVERALLI would definitely come back especially I\'ve been craving New York bagels. It might not be as good as the ones in New York but this definitely satisfies my craving!', ""Busy on a Sunday morning.Pros:-Bagel enthusiasts take note! Tons of cream cheese and bagel selections. I'm not a bagel person, but can vouch for the cream cheese being excellent-Chocolate rugelach was so good! This was my top pick of all of the bakery items I tried by far (sorry no photo) because it was perfectly buttery. Get this if you like rugelach!Cons:-Donut dough was a little stale tasting (2.5-3/5 for donuts)"", ""Stumbled across this bakery one day after getting some ice cream, and absolutely loved it! Their bagels and cream cheese were so yummy and we even grabbed some to take home. I don't live super close to the area but would totally make the drive here again!"", ""Placed an online order for in-store pickup on a Thursday morning, and it was ready within 30 minutes. They do not currently have indoor seating, and the outdoor seating was tied up possibly due to the rain. You can walk a few steps down the road and find a bench to eat. The Hynes sandwich was delectable! They certainly do not skimp on the ingredients, and it is well worth the price. They also have a HUGE selection of bakery goods, it's hard to walk away without buying something."", ""The place is very clean. There's very limited seating if you care about that. But the Boylston bagel (chive cream cheese, tomato, and onion) was one of the best bagels I've ever had. Everything tasted super fresh and delicious! They also have prepared foods like whitefish salad ready to go, which I might pick up next time."", ""I'be been craving a New York bagel but haven't found a place that gets it right. I decided to give Kupel's a try and I was NOT disappointed.The bagels are large, but the filling ratio is absolutely perfect. I got the Brookline Village (cream cheese, lox, tomato, red onion) on an Everything bagel--so good!Now I'll be craving Kupel's. I went around noon on a Wednesday; no line and my food was ready within a few minutes. Indoor seating is limited (a small counter with only a few seats) but they have quite a few picnic tables outside."", ""The baseline bagel is good - good size, good texture, they're soft, not too dense, but all the flavors were lacking, bland and left us wanting more. Whole wheat everything - it has a different combination of everything bagel seasonings such as caraway seeds and oats. It was lacking the pungent onion/garlic stank of your typical everything bagel Onions bagel - pretty standard but again, was very mild and lacking flavor. The onions must be mixed in because there was nothing on the exterior? Chive cream cheese - good texture and creaminess, but needs MORE chive. If ordering with cream cheese there is a good bagel to schmear ratio and they don't over toast if you select that option. We order a container of tuna to-go, along with 2 challah rolls and a raspberry hammantashen, which had an interesting lemon flavor on the crust, but didn't quite do it for me. The tuna, like everything else, was bland. Good thing we got it to go and could jazz it up at home. Challah rolls were great, definitely get those. Convenient online ordering for covid safe pickup. There are a few cute tables outdoors for covid safe dining too."", 'Outstanding bagels and friendly staff - people behind me in line compared it to Essabagel in NYC and I have to agree. Egg bagels are spot on. I got the Back Bay on an egg bagel, half moon cookie, and a raspberry cheese pastry. I was thoroughly pleased with it all. Black coffee was perfect. They also sell day old bagels/pastries for cheap. ($5.99 for a bakers dozen)']",negative

Unless you're a celebrity chef just stick to making good Hawaiian food and leave the fancy to the pros. The parts of the meals were good, even excellent but unnecessarily skimping on things in the name of being fancy leads to the low rating. If a loco moco has onions don't put 6 onion pieces on it. That's weak. The Portuguese sausage was amazing but the fried rice with it had too tough a texture to just spread a thin layer of it. A little more rice please. Cheap stuff that just doesn't need to be skimped on. Why doesn't the hash plate come with an egg? \xa0More unnecessary skimping.

"[""I've been to Wolfies three times so far and this review is a summary based on those three experiences. First of all, this is not a fine dining restaurant. This is a casual culinary adventure2. The staff (in and out of the kithcen) take their ingredients seriously."", ""Mmmmm! Got to try Wolfies out for lunch yesterday and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised!I usually feel sickly full after an Italian lunch, but Wolfies had fabulous, fresh options with no grease in sight!I'd describe the interior as rustic, Italian eclectic. This goes with the White Wolf Cafe vibe, but has a lot of authentic Italian charm. When we arrived the restaurant was empty but people did start to come in after 12. The service was great! I hope this was just a slow day because this place deserves to be packed for lunch!I started with a half portions of the arugula salad, but soon realized that this could have been my full lunch! I can't imagine how big the full portion is! It was delicious- filled with a rainbow of tomatoes and grated parm. I will say that it was pretty salty- and that's coming from a girl that loves her salt!We then went ahead and ordered the Colonial pizza. The small size was perfect for sharing! I'm not normally a fan of blue cheese, but the way everything was put together really highlighted the flavors and I found myself hurrying towards the next bite! Another great addition is the apple slices on this pizza. I thought that they would be large, cumbersome slices laid out on top of the pizza for show, but they were actually cut up in bite-sized pieces and baked right into the pizza (under the cheese!). It didn't look impressive, but it was MUCH better this way!I'll definitely be back to try their dinner selection!"", ""Pizzatime! New lovely pizza spot in Ivanhoe Village from the much loved White Wolf Cafe. It's a hop away from there as well, a few doors down.It has the same antique setting with much personality. Love the ambiance and large wood tables and booths. It's a more intimate setting with a few tables. Dine in for lunch or dinner and they deliver now! This may be my new go-to delivery pizza spot when I move into College Park a few streets over. It is not busy during lunch yet so you can stop in here and get seated quickly. I started with the Arugula Salad - Cherry heirloom tomatoes, fresh Parmigiana Regianno, lemon, olive oil & salt & pepper. It was delicious, fresh and started the meal off perfect. I got a half of a serving and it was a good size, check out the pic. We split the The Mills specialty pizza -Tomato, mozzarella, sausage, mushroom, olives & sweet peppers. At first I didn't want olives because I assumed they were black as that is popular at other pizza spots but this is a fresh spot so they let me know they were marinated Kalamata olives... I kept them and they were literally the highlight of the pizza. It added that natural salt flavor the pizza needed. They are thinner pizzas but they don't skimp on the toppings. It was a little sandy on the bottom but the crust was delicious. Overall, great new pizza spot and I can't wait to try their fresh pasta! They also have a nice crafty cocktail menu and they all looked delicious so I will be back soon for sure. Check them out!"", ""I was invited back to Wolfie's by the Executive Chef, Jason Schofield, for dinner and he did not disappoint. \xa0The last time I went to Wolfie's, he was out of the country and I could tell a big difference this time around with him tending to the kitchen. \xa0We started off with their meatball appetizer, which were hands down the best meatballs I have ever had. \xa0Perfectly browned on the outside, moist on the inside and the red sauce they come in was the perfect compliment. \xa0Unfortunately, we devoured them in a matter of minutes before I could remember to take a picture of the beautiful dish, so instead there's one of our empty plate. \xa0I then moved on to a small caesar salad, which had a wonderful creamy caesar dressing on it and fresh grated parmesan. \xa0When it came time for the entree, we made our own pizza. \xa0Mozzarella, buffalo mozzarella, parmesan, italian sausage and prosciutto. \xa0The crust is thin and on the crispy side, which is the way I like it. \xa0It holds up really well and doesn't get soggy from the sauce and cheeses. \xa0I'm very picky when it comes to prosciutto, and they have some of the best. \xa0I believe they cure their own meats here and the prosciutto is not fatty and has a really great flavor. \xa0I don't think you could go wrong with any of their pizzas.We ended our meal with some dessert. \xa0I had the tiramisu and my friend had the olive oil gelato with a rosemary, thyme and lemon cookie crisp on the top. \xa0The tiramisu was very light and delicate with no ingredient overpowering the other, it was pure heaven. \xa0I got to try some of the olive oil gelato which was quite tasty as well. \xa0It was very interesting, but in a good way. \xa0It was light in flavor with a creamy texture. \xa0The cookie was a great compliment.

I love their salads (big enough to share) and their pizzas have a great crust to cheese ratio.Some favorites from our dinner was my starter cocktail, Mediterranean Mule, and the tiramisu was amazing. I actually wasn\'t planning on eating more than a bite or two of my husband\'s tiramisu but once I got a taste of the creamy goodness I couldn\'t stop eating it.As always I love the ambiance of the place.

This will be both a review and a tribute to a great little pizzeria. Always heard pretty good things about the place but hadn\'t had a chance to check it out myself. I was disappointed when news broke that it would be closing down. So I made plans and invited a friend out to dinner this past Saturday for our first/last visit. I loved the cozy dimly lit dining room and how the decor, furniture & cabinetry all added to the rustic feel of the space. We ordered a round of drinks and an appetizer to start. I had the Garden of Eden which was a smooth gin based cocktail with pomegranate juice, fig syrup & amaro nonino. The Meatballs were a great app to share for two. The veal, pork & brisket mix was a nice blend of flavors. In an effort to maximize the experience we ordered an entree each and also decided to split a 18"" Il Bello Maiale. There was a fig vinaigrette on the pizza that complemented the smoked pork belly & roasted peppers really well. The crust was thicker than traditional pizzas, but it\'s quality was good so I didn\'t mind. We were of course expecting leftovers but the portions on my friends Eggplant Parmesan and my Lasagna were huge. Being a fan of wetter Lasagna\'s the generous amount of cheese and sauce really hit the spot. The meal left a good enough impression that I came back again for dinner on Sunday. This time I tried the garlic knots with pig butter which were amazing. Once again the fresh dough really shines through. I was also excited to taste the hand made pappardelle in the Pasta Bolognese. The red wine ragù was savory and the pasta had terrific bite to it. I couldn\'t resist ordering one last pie to go, just to sample the house cured spicy coppa & bresaola. I thoroughly enjoyed everything I was able to squeeze into my two visits. Again sad to see the place go, since it\'s right in my new hood. But the staff did mention that the owners were debating carrying over some of the menu items. So even though Wolfies is gone, maybe we\'ll see some iteration of the namesake pizzas and/or dishes pop up at White Wolf Cafe.', ""Almost everything on the menu including all of the breads, pasta, dough, salumi, and most of the cheeses are made in house and what other ingredients they do use are sourced locally and sustainably when available. Chef AJ Haines even cures all of his meats and cheeses in house, so don't ask for boring old pepperoni on your pizza. All sausages and charcuterie are aged and seasoned in a charcuterie drying cabinet that is on display in the dining room.We started our tasting adventure with a skewer of Compressed Melon topped with Prosciutto, Fried Basil and Blue Cheese. A perfect savory and sweet treat to whet our appetites. Our next dish was a Mini Charcuterie Plate of Bresaola, Filleto, House Cured Provolone with a baguette and a side of pig butter. The flavor from the house cured meats and cheese was superb.Wolfies is a very unique place with lots of great food and a great atmosphere."", 'Awesome pizza. Best in Orlando.

Just start your movie, hit ""pause"" when you hear the doorbell, pay and enjoy. The Mills and The College Park are my favorites so far. Not too cheesy, the sauce is delicious and the ingredients are fresh and tasty. The crust is thin (I\'m not a fan of thicker crust pizza) and quite tasty. No ""dipping"" sauces are needed.', ""The chef here cures his own meats and makes his own cheeses! We've gotten to know Chef Jason from his down low dining events he's held in this space over the years. I'm really glad they turned this great space into Wolfie's Pizzamia. They have a lot of creative menu toppings and I'm so impressed with all the Italian meats he cures and makes himself. Many of those meats are also toppings in the pizzas.Go with a group, order the Salumi platter a nice salad and a pizza and share all around the table.

I'm from LA, so it was just the best kind of just the right amount of hot. I guess the secret is carrots, to mellow the spice without losing the flavor of the habanero pepper.

"['Decided to order the All Three Flavors, so I could try them all. \xa0Turned out to be a *huge* portion of chicken, which meant leftovers. \xa0I was going to try the bone-in, but went with the boneless since that seems to be the specialty here. \xa0Philosophically, I still prefer wings, but I did enjoy their boneless pieces.Original (Boneless): Tender thigh meat inside and crispy batter outside. \xa0Felt lighter with a flakier batter than if you got tenders or popcorn chicken from the major fried chicken chains. \xa0Guess that\'s the magic of Korean Fried Chicken.Sweet and Spicy (Boneless): A little more personality than the original. \xa0But because of the thick sauce, you gotta eat this fast so it doesn\'t soften. \xa0Sauce seemed more sweet than spicy.House Special (Boneless): I really enjoyed this one because it was basically ""Umami & Spicy"", so better than the sweet & spicy option and a little spicier overall. \xa0Especially with the stir fried scallion whites, which taste great against the chicken.Pickled Radish: Pretty standard for a pickled radish. \xa0But is quite helpful for cleansing the palate between rich chicken bites.Mac Salad: A nice cooling side that works well with the spicier options. \xa0It\'s like being at an old school picnic!', 'While visiting Austin I decided to give this place a try because I love my wings. I forgot what I had ordered but I ordered the larger portion. It was tasty but it didn\'t wow me. I don\'t know what it was but it just didn\'t do the trick to make me want to come again. Maybe it could\'ve been the flavors I chose. I would try it again to see if I like the other flavors but from the one I had I thought it was missing the ""wow factor"". The staff was very friendly and the location was great. Right in the middle of downtown and near the campus.', ""Nasty. I had the corn cheese chicken here and it was SOUR. SOUR!!!

I was craving fried chicken and I guess the signs outside got me. I got the boneless original medium chicken. It was really good and crispy. They included two sauces: one was sweet and spicy and the other was ranch. They also included some peanuts + sesame seeds but I didn't use it. The chicken is super crispy and service was really fast, my order was ready in less than 10 minutes. Will definitely come back when I'm craving fried chicken again!"", ""I got the bone in chicken wings and there wasn't one wing it was all spine and rips it was full of bones and hard to eat.

Ask questions about the menu-the staff are happy to explain anything that may need further explanation. The outdoor seating space in the back is really cool. Slower service, but the food was good, hot and flavorful, so I'm not worried about the slower time it took, because I know it was made fresh for me."", 'I got the house special chicken which was well, nothing special. Not bad, not amazing. My biggest complaint was that in creating the pieces of chicken, they chopped outside of the joints, resulting in lots of random bone shards in the meat.

"[""A+ as always. How can you go wrong with a comfy chicken biscuit? A comfy chicken biscuit is like a warm hug in food form. The biscuit is the soft pillow, topped by a perfectly seasoned juicy chicken breast, then it's blessed by steamy white gravy.

Much appreciated his hospitality!Something important to note is that Home Grown carries all sorts of cool local art that will make great gifts for your friends and family!

I love you so much Home Grown!"", ""We somehow managed to bike here (ATL you got way too many hills)... This place is oozes with that hipster vibe, but no matter. We just came for the food.We got a good ol' fashioned, sloppy chicken biscuit, with gravy. Ate it in their outside eating area (due to covid- and due to the fact the place was packed on the inside). The verdict: it was pretty damned good. Pretty damned sloppy, but pretty damned good.So good I'm not even gonna hate on that hipster vibe... check'em out."", 'Our go to breakfast joint and for good reasons!To start with the location is great, right off the belt line and right near everything.

They offered quick service and hot food. The food tasted good and the service was great. I'd go back and try different dishes! It's a small spot with minimal seating, it has a nice homely feel!"", ""That Comfy Chicken Biscuit will knock you OUT!If Atlanta has a go-to breakfast item, I would argue that it has to be the Chicken Biscuit. Served with gravy, jam, or just by itself, the humble Chicken Biscuit is the one menu item you use to separate the great breakfast spots from the rest. When it comes to Home Grown's Comfy Chicken Biscuit, it's pretty damn hard to top this mountain of protein, fat, and carbs.Home Grown in and of itself is an interesting signpost for the New South and what Atlanta is \xa0(or strives to be) in the 21st Century. A rustic-looking one story building with green accents, it's located on State Route 154/Memorial Drive right next to a particularly scenic leg of the Atlanta BeltLine. Inside the restaurant, however, the vibe can only be described as ATL punk. From alt culture stickers to hoodie-wearing employees whose sleeves are barely covering up a mosaic of tattoos on their bodies, this is not what I expected to see at one of ATL's most popular breakfast spots... which I suppose is the point. This ain't your granddaddy's Atlanta for sure.While Home Grown's Comfy Chicken Biscuit may have started as an off-menu employee meal special, it is definitely one of the more popular items to order now: practically every other customer around me had an order sitting in front of them. When they bring it to you, it is a sight to behold: hills of fried chicken presented open face on biscuits, with a thick gravy covering everything like a blanket. Served with a slice of orange, it's an almost comical sight... until you reach the end of the meal and realize that a little bit of citrus actually helps cut the fattiness just enough so that you're able to peel yourself off your seat.At $12 for the Comfy Chicken Biscuit and $3 for a bowl of Cheese Grits, add on a coffee and a cup of orange juice and it'll run you about $20 for breakfast here. If breakfast is the most important meal of the day, that's a reasonable price to load up on all that food. However, if you're a regular person with a regular routine, the Comfy Chicken Biscuit will probably put you out of commission for the rest of the day... after a meal like that, a comfy sofa or a warm, soft bed beckons. Having had many Chicken Biscuit meals in Atlanta by now, I find myself wondering why the chicken is never made from dark meat and why the biscuits are never as soft and flaky on the inside as I would like it? Maybe that would be overkill, but I feel like a brined-and-battered chicken thigh over fluffy-yet-flaky biscuits covered in sausage gravy would take the dish to the next level... but who am I, a Southern California boy, to comment on such things?Just know when you visit Home Grown that you're in for a whale of a breakfast... and make sure you check out of their art displays here too! The Sew Thrifty 5 & Dime is a showcase of local artisanal creations that definitely adds to the unconventional mystique of this place."", ""My friend mentioned that we stop at Home Grown while we were in town visiting. I'm always looking for a good brunch and my husband tends to want a lumberjack's sized breakfast and the photos from Yelp looked promising.My husband ordered the salmon with cheese grits.

The grits were yellow from the cheese, but I didn't pick up a strong cheesy flavor.I ordered their chicken and waffles With a side of breakfast potatoes. It was good, the star of the dosh was the side of potatoes that I would order again.We got out son a $4 sausage and cheese biscuit. He didn't leave a crumb so it must have been tasty! My daughter was waking up from a nap and didn't really want much to eat. I ordered her a side order of pancakes...when it arrived I had to look at the menu and do a double take, making sure I didn't order a full size when I just wanted a side. I had in fact, only ordered a side pancake, but it was huge!!!!

Sitting at the counter, you\'ll get the full experience of hospitality from the staff here. The menu was composed of both breakfast and brunch selections, and I started off with the egg biscuit and ham biscuit sandwiches, each built on a fluffy, soft homemade biscuit. For a particularly Southern dish, I tried the Lynne Stack, composed of a salmon patty, a slice of fried green tomato, sautéed spinach, and roasted tomatoes, all covered in melted pimento cheese. The salmon patty had a nice meaty texture and seafood flavor, and the fried green tomato came with the most delicious crispy, spicy, peppery breading. The vegetables added a nice earthy, bright flavor to the dish, but the highlight was the melted pimento cheese, which had a slightly spicy flavor and thick, creamy texture. The server described this brunch plate as a ""flavor bomb,"" and on that front, it certainly did not disappoint!', 'Always come here with the boys when we want a nice brunch. Nothing too crazy looking from the outside, but the food is always right on', ""I had been here years ago and had their comfy chicken biscuit. I came back years later and the whole area is brand new, which is awesome. Years ago this was the only restaurant around that area. The lines were super long. That part hasn't changed.

I love all the artwork all around the restaurant and the different stickers everywhere. For breakfast, I had the breakfast enchiladas and my friend had the comfy chicken biscuit. Both were amazing! I was craving breakfast burritos, but the breakfast enchiladas were able to still hit the spot. On the comfy chicken biscuit, the chicken is boneless and a great flavoring and pairs well with their gravy. The biscuit is fluffy and amazing too. Their menu is huge, so if you're indecisive like me, it might help you to look at it before hand so when you get there it is easier to make a decision. It might not make it easier to make the decision, but at least you'll be more familiar with all the choices :)"", 'Plain and simple but delicious and really nice staff.

Perhaps I don't like whiting in general or it was a bit old and too thinly cut. I looked up whiting and it says it is a mild flavored fish. This was anything but mild and the pieces were very think which made it dry. The shrimp was ok but also, I think, a bit over cooked and very little flavor. The fries were crispy but not very flavorful. The slaw was my favorite part of lunch! It was rough chopped and had a great flavor!

It is oozing with steampunk and whimsy! This on a Disney level of immersion, which is saying something! Even the music they played in the restaurant fits the theming!

Something that surprised me when I went is that there are two walk-around characters that come to your table and you can get pictures with them.

There's also a confectionery shop in the building selling candy, baked sweets and merchandise. It's been since 2018 since I've eaten here, so I don't remember how much it cost (as it was a family of 6 in our party).

Three of our party ordered the teriyaki salmon, an order of short rib dinner, and I ordered a seared tuna salad and asked no onions as I have a severe allergy.We waited and waited. No one asked if we wanted another drink. Food arrives an hour later at our table and my salad came with tons of onions. The others started eating their food and the salmon was fishy and freezer burned for two out of the three dishes ordered. One dish the rice was very crunchy. Veggies were microwaved and soggy.

The shakes are shareable sizes in my opinion. The chocolates are heavenly treats for your tastebuds! Dining experience is fun- they have some interesting twists on their menu. This most recent visit was a very long wait for walk ins (book a reservation if you can)- we waited over the quoted time of an hour and they had messed up our check-in, putting us in for a table of 4 when there was just 2 of us- that we fixed at the one hour mark when we checked to see how much longer. Once seating, I had hoped for faster service- we got drinks and placed orders for our dinners. I let our server know about my food allergy and she helped me navigate what I couldn't order. I went with a chicken dish and 40 minutes after I ordered she came out to inform me the dish included peppers (my allergy) and I had to pick something else. Sigh- again, my stars show my total experiences here- not this one, because it would have been a lower rating. Needless to say- our food didn't arrive for over an hour after ordering. I ended up with the Alfredo pasta with shrimp and was bummed I didn't get a veggie with my meal- the other plates I was looking at all came with protein, starch and veggie.

The whole cream is also tasty. But overall it was nothing ""wow"". Average brookie and hard, stale tasting cookie.

I would've preferred sitting inside because the decor and vintage vibes. But we enjoyed eating outside in the seventy+ degree weather, especially since the next day we'd return back home to the frigid cold. I got the mushroom flatbread but wouldn't recommend - the crust was very thin and overcooked, practically burnt. AAlthough the toppings were plentiful, the overall taste wasn't anything to rave about. I tried the meatloaf which was also subpar. The tenderloin however was shockingly good - I was surprised how well the chocolate paired with pork and the veggies were not just pretty but tasty too!

My family decided on a whim to get out of the house on a really nice December day and found ourselves riding on those electric scooter do-hickies from Krog Street to Piedmont Park.My son recommended New Realm after having eaten here before with friends, and since he rarely makes suggestions, we went with it. The wait time was about 30 minutes for a 4-top table or pretty immediate if we had chosen one of the first come first serve beltline patio table, to which you have to do your own clean-up work. It's been a while since we've had the pleasure of both our boys on a family outing, so we decided a regular service table was better.

The dip was creamy and had good crab flavoring, but fell flat because there were no other flavors. The tomatoes added a subtle crunch to the dish, and the pita was hard.

"[""We made reservations for our last day in ATL and we are so happy we didn't leave without making a stop here. It was a little difficult to get to as the restaurant is tucked away in between two parking lots. We thought we could park anywhere, but it appeared that this was a valet only restaurant. We were a bit shocked to hear how cheap valet is in ATL compared to our hometown! Check in was easy. We were kindly greeted by the host who was able to guide us to our seats quickly. Our first thoughts were the restaurant was extremely dark for 5pm. We were greeted by our server, Richard, who was a gem! He was very welcoming and friendly. Throughout our dinner, our server was busy and was serving multiple tables however he did an outstanding job at serving us all. Although he was busy he was still attentive. Richard was very knowledgable and explained every dish we had questions about. He also made some great suggestions which were all very delish! We ordered the following:-Shishito Peppers-Rock Shrimp-Dumplings-Lobster Temaki-Mt. Fuji 2x-The O-Kurrr-The Soft Shell Spider-Sugar and Spice cocktails x2-Otoro Nigiri-Unagi Nigiri x2-Uni Nigiri-Japan-SapporoBoy were we pleased with the food and drinks! The shishito peppers were really spice so be aware. The rock shrimp was flavorful and delicious. The dumplings were pan fried perfectly with the perfect crisp. OH! The lobster temaki were a huge hit. We absolutely loved them and that was the first thing we inhaled lol. All the raw sushi and nigiri's were very fresh and authentic. Our sweet server remembered we were here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday when he asked us what brought us in today and brought out a plate of mochi ice-cream at the end of our meal which was very sweet. Overall, we were very impressed. We were happy with how attentive our server was. He was super busy and still managed to satisfy our needs. 5 stars for service. 5 stars for drinks. 5 starts for food! Hands down one of my favorite restaurants we have yet to visit in ATL. We can't want to be back here soon!"", ""Very pleasant experience!As a vegan, I'm always glad to have an option at a sushi restaurant that's more than just an avocado roll or a cucumber roll. The herbivore roll is inherently vegan and was very nice! Also had the shishito peppers (also vegan) and they were delish! Unfortunately the crispy rice is not vegan. Will have to go back cauliflower dish, which I was informed is vegan.The sake was nice -- could have been served warmer.The service was good! Friendly and attentive wait staff.We sat on the rooftop, which was enclosed. This is great to protect you from the elements, but I was expecting a view of some kind (I thought I had read somewhere that the view is great, but I could be mistaken). Unfortunately the plastic/glass was not completely transparent and obstructs any view that might be there. I enjoyed soaking in the last sun rays of the day tho!We arrived when they opened at 5pm and the hostess as well as both of our servers all mentioned they had a private party at 7pm on the roof so we would have to finish before then. They were friendly about it and simply informing us (plus we had a show to attend at 7!), but I could see this being a turn off to others who wanted to take their time.My date is a big sushi critic from NY (not vegan) -- always complained about not being able to find quality sushi in Atl -- and this turned all that around!!! Yay Oku!!"", ""for parking- valet is a great choice and comes to be cheaper than parking in deck food was excellent- mt Fuji roll was everyone's favoritewould definitely recommend going during happy hour- good deals and you can get a lot of sushireally nice ambiance and great drink menu!!"", ""First thoughts when walking in, O-Ku is pretty dark. I've been to the location in Charlotte, NC, but as my first time here in Atlanta, it was nice to see what other locations were offering. One thing to note though is that if you're the first one here, it'll be a bit chilly so definitely recommend to wear a sweater. If you're wondering about parking, I highly highly recommend to valet as it'll be cheaper than parking in the parking deck next door with parkmobile. It makes absolutely no sense, but there you have it. We made it simple. We got the Omakase for $125/person. So as of 12/30/21, what we got as dishes are, listed by course:1 Salmon with yuzu and volcanic salt2 Assortment of sashimi2.5 Mackerel3 Uni (sea urchin) with brown butter atop of blow torched rice4 Yellow tail salmon belly, miso yaki (cod)5 Hamachi with ponzu powder6 O-toro topped with truffle, smoked Hamachi, sake caviar salmon7 Matcha cake with almond ice creamOverall, it was great. We came out super full and satisfied for sure. Was it worth it? I think it was considering the amount of food. The omakase in Charlotte was also worth it as well so I'm glad that O-ku carries through their quality to different cities and other locations. Service was great as well, our waiter was awesome and explained our courses and also got us a couple of bonus courses.I would definitely recommend if you are new to an omakase experience to try O-ku and it'll open your eyes to new experiences!"", ""Came here on a weekend evening. My friends wanted to sit downstairs but it seemed that they were having some sort of larger party and that we had to sit upstairs. No biggie. We walk up the side of the building to the upstairs and immediately I get this whiff of hectic energy. It seems like no one is really working and there's no sort of organization upstairs unlike downstairs. We manage to find this nook to sit in with this tiny table.It took a bit of time for a server to greet us. My friends and I shared a bottle of chardonnay, which took 20 min to get to our table. We ordered a couple appetizers for the table which were the edamame and the crispy rice. Both the appetizers arrived relatively quickly which was good. They added way too much salt on top of the edamame to the point where I had to scrape it off. The crispy rice was okay overall, the spicy sashimi part was a good flavor and creaminess but the rice was clearly prepared early and wasn't freshly crisped since it was a bit on the colder side. For my entree, I ordered the over the rainbow roll, the Mt. fuji roll, and the sake nigiri. The order took in excess of 45 minutes to arrive and by the time it arrived we were one of the last two tables upstairs. The sushi rice was not only bland but cold and dry. I could tell it was refrigerated and not freshly prepared, honestly probably hands down one of the worst price to rice quality ratios in the Atlanta sushi scene. The fresh fish part of the sake nigiri was actually quite excellent and possessed the buttery texture that salmon is known for in the sushi world. The toppings on the rainbow roll were okay but nothing to write home about. Another flagrant issue was the tempura shrimp in the Mt. Fuji roll which was cold and limp - exactly the opposite you want in a freshly fried tempura. The sushi and service here simply do not match well with West Midtown. I've been to dozens of sushi restaurants ITP and OTP and I can confidently say this was one of my worst experiences yet especially for the price point. I've also worked and still currently pick up shifts at my family's multiple sushi and hibachi restaurants and this place is a sad excuse for what I know can be good service and good food. If you want to enjoy some decent sushi and service in this area, simply head down the street to Eight Sushi Lounge - O-ku just isn't it."", ""I am always a huge fan of O-Ku!! They partner up with Yelp and many nonprofit organizations to raise awareness for lots of causes. This place is always busy \xa0I enjoy the raw authentic taste of their food. Its taste is pure.

The Interlock block party was happening, so we checked that out first and called the restaurant to see if we were able to be a little late. The hostess said we had a 10 or 15-minute grace period (I can't remember which); however, when we got there, we were told our reservation was no longer available and we'd have to try sitting at the bar because there were no tables available - although there were several empty tables that remained empty throughout the night...but all good lol.We found three seats at the bar and one not the bartenders, I think his name was Miles, was super nice! We shared edamame and rock shrimp which were both good. Then I ordered two rolls - Follow the Yellow Brick Roll and Mt. Fuji, which were really good. Mt. Fuji was probably my fave as the lemon peel on Follow the Yellow Brick Roll was a bit much after a while.Overall, I enjoyed my experience and have to come back soon to actually try out the rooftop."", ""Very nice place! \xa0Nice vibes, friendly waiter.The only small issue was the food didn't come out in the right order. \xa0The appetizer and entree came out at the same time. \xa0So don't order everything at the same time. \xa0 Also I ordered more food later - dumplings- and it took a long time to come. \xa0So just know this going in.Nigil's....both goodSalmon bellyBlack cod Dumplings - yum!Sunset sushi roll - \xa0very good!!!!Short ribs- well bf didn't share I guess to good to share.We will be back."", 'O-ku sushi has brought back their happy hour and what a treat it has been to spend an evening there!

The mount fuji takes the crown though and you must order it the next time you visit O-ku.My friend and I sat on the rooftop and since it was a weeknight it was relatively empty.

It also comes with the spicy feta, tzatziki, fries, tomatoes, onions, and pita bread. Not only does it taste amazing but it is such a great value!!

We were able to beat the rush of people who came in following us. There were a couple of small spaces to sit down and eat as well as outside, but given that it was cold and raining, those seats weren't available. The workers were super friendly and quick as preparing the food. My friend ordered the lamb bowl with zucchini chips and tzatziki while I had the pork gyro with spicy feta. Trying a bit of both of our foods, I did prefer the pork over the lamb. Although equally as flavorful, I found the pork more tender and moist. The gyro was a fun and convenient way to eat since it was so compact and efficient at having a bit of pork, fries, tomato and feta in every bite. The pita was soft and I really enjoyed the zucchini chips which were crisp, perfect for the light tzatziki sauce. For dessert, we shared the loukoumades with custard, pistachios, honey and shaved filo. The toppings were good but other I could tell the loukoumades weren't fries and given time to soak up the honey like other homemade versions I've had before. In addition, I'm not sure if it was the filo or pistachios that were almost rock like when eating. Would come again to try more items from their menu."", ""I stopped by around noon and shouldv'e definitely ordered online for pick up to avoid lunch traffic. I ordered the veggie plate with fries and the classic loukoumades (greek style doughnuts). The wait wasn't too bad, considering it was peak lunch hour. The veggie plate was super filling. I'm not sure I would order the classic loukoumades again because they were doused in so much honey, so it was too sweet for my liking. I would come back to try the other two toppings though."", ""Solid meal; I would say it's more like a 3.5. I ordered the classic lamb pita with Greco fries. I think the classic lamb pita was a bit too oily for my liking and could have been better if it had lettuce or tomatoes or another fresh ingredient--I think it only came with meat, onions, and sauce. Although I appreciate how much meat there was, I think a balance of veggies and meat would have been better. The meat was actually pretty tender and well seasoned; sometimes I am skeptical of lamb since it can be tough if not cooked properly. I did like the tzatziki sauce it came with, it tasted homemade and creamy. The Greco fries were nothing special. I was expecting a little more seasoning or toppings besides the cheese and maybe oregano."", 'I had the veggie wrap of zucchini fritters, fries and sauces and got some zucchini chips on the side.

The chips were not evenly seasoned, leaving some to be fantastic, and others to be bland.', ""Greco is a great option for quick counter-service food on Newbury Street that's not too overpriced (at least by Newbury standards!).The menu here is comprised of gyros, salads, BYO plates, innovative sides, and even some Greek doughnuts (was too full to try on my first visit, but sounded really tasty!).I tried the loukaniko (pork/leek sausage) wrap, and it was definitely a winner. The sausage was flavorful and juicy, and the fries/potatoes on the wrap were perfectly fresh. My only tiny gripe was that the sausage was super salty, but about halfway through I got used to it - and overall it was still a great wrap.I tried a few of my friend's zucchini chips, and would definitely recommend those as well - light, very thinly sliced, and one of those rare fried snacks that doesn't actually feel greasy at all.The food comes up quick, and the indoor space, although small, wasn't overly crowded on a weekday night around dinner time (maybe we just got lucky?)It also seems they do a lot of takeout orders - honestly, if I lived closer, I'd be hitting this place up all the time for takeout."", 'For a quick work lunch this Monday noon I walked over to Greco. Walking past the outdoor seating on street level and descending a half flight of stairs, I reached the interior, which possessed the light wood, large windows, and exposed concrete necessary for new, trendy restaurants (aka ""industrial chic""). My order consisted of the following- Loukaniko Pita | $10.50- Zucchini Chips | $4.5Originally, I planned on ordering the lamb gyro. However, the Loukaniko Pita, with pork and leek sausage, caught my eye. The sausage had the same texture and grill char as other gyro (like beef), but with a much sweeter savoriness. (imagine the difference between normal ground pork and a ground pork and leek or cabbage dumpling). That, cut by mustard, proved satisfying. I initially thought the portion size too small, but I underestimated the staying power of pita bread and ""hand cut potatoes"" (read: fries) inside the pita. The zucchini fries tasted like crack - of the salt and oil variety. I appreciated the rendering of a vegetable into something unhealthy.On a side note, gyro with fries seemed quite Californian. I did not expect to find it here.', 'We wanted to try a new dessert and this came up in the recommendations. We ordered the Loukoumades(Greek donuts).

The prices are not bad at all for a fast-casual spot on Newbury!Came here on a hot weekday evening. The indoor seating was completely full and the cooks were busy preparing takeout orders. I got a bifteki pita wrap ($10.50) and bougatsa loukoumades ($7). My order was done in about 10 minutes. I noticed that others who only ordered pita wraps got their orders within a minute of paying-- the donuts probably take more time.There are small tables outside to sit at and I highly recommend grabbing a small stack of napkins from the store if you plan to eat outside. The pita wrap was stuffed with meat and fries and was a bit messy to eat.The bifteki was hearty and very flavorful. I loved the spicy feta it came with (and they gave a lot of it). The fries were crispy and nicely seasoned, too.Even if I happened to eat dinner somewhere else, I'd come here just for their loukoumades. The donuts are soft and chewy (almost reminded me of mochi donuts). The bougatsa (custard creme, phyllo, cinnamon) was not too sweet. I could honestly eat the entire box by myself.

I couldn't get enough of it. The pastrami sandwich was unique with its kimchi, but it was pretty salty for my taste. After a couple of bites, I couldn't finish it.

The music was loud and it was very crowded but the overall vibe was great. I was late to my reservation and they still were able to seat us right away. I got the bae and home fries. It was so good!

There is plexiglass all around the bar and in between grouped seating. The waiters all wear masks and the restaurant has QR code menus. Ok, now that we got the technical stuff out of the way.. THE BOOZY DONUT!! Absolute BOMB! They have a different donut of the day with a different shot so ask your waiter. Best donut I've ever had and I don't even like strawberry shortcake. They have yard sticks filled with mimosas for groups of 4+ or you can just order a bottle of bubbly and pick out of a wide variety of juices. We had the breakfast pizza and it was delicious. Never thought of putting an egg on a pizza but will definitely do that again. It's enough for 2 people. The restaurant plays top 40 music in the background which leads to a very fun atmosphere.

Nice wooden tables and chairs to sit at along with electric candles and dim lighting to give that vibe of a very special night out. The whole restaurant is set up to give you the feel of a very big party as well. It's really nice to look at if you have the chance to stop by in the evening.Onto the food, my group ordered the Calamari Fritti and Adriatico for appetizers. They were not the greatest I've had but were okay. I didn't have too much of a problem with the calamari. The tiger prawns for the adriatico didn't seem to have much of a taste. Either that or I missed it due to my cold. Just felt like I was having any normal prawn in all honesty.For my main, I had the Salmone 'La Piazza'. My first thought was that I got a really small serving of food. I didn't really think I was going to have a filling meal based on the size. I would turn out to be right as I wasn't entirely satisfied with the meal. I liked salmon and I thought it was cooked well. It just tasted like a regular salmon dish though so I didn't really see anything special from it. Not the worst result but I was hoping for more.I had a satisfactory time here.

The soft serve was delicious, creamy, not icy. \xa0They have chocolate and vanilla always, and rotate out a third flavor each week. \xa0I've even heard rumors that they do a Butterbeer flavor sometimes! \xa0Now we know where to go when we want our twist cone fix, even if it is 25 miles away from our house. \xa0Worth it!"", ""Didn't care for this place at all. The toppings were run of the mill things you could purchase yourself at a grocery store and didn't really stand up to the hype I was expecting.

I must say overall that I wasn't all that happy. The shop was located in a nice little array of other shops, the atmosphere was really nice and everything in terms of environment was grade A. What I wasn't happy with was the ice cream itself and I wasn't the only one. I being a sweets guy love some ice cream, but this stuff was just way too sweet which I rarely ever say. The candied pecans were loaded with sugar and the banana bread didn't clash well with the ice cream. I would've been much more satisfied with the plain vanilla and some caramel sauce. On top of that the items weren't very big. I paid like $9 for a large which was decent sized, but just seemed like a waste of money.

Ice cream used to be creamy, almost like a frozen custard and what I had today tasted like normal ice cream from the grocery store or more like Golden Corral no joke.

Think my only suggestion would be I wished they were cooked in a true ""fosters"" fashion. Others got a bit more crazy and chose larger sizes. Lots of happy car club peeps left and made our way to the next destination. Overall, Cow Tipping was our second fave only being beaten out by prohibition in east Austin.

There is literally something for everyone. Each ice cream starts out with either vanilla, chocolate, or swirl soft serve. Then you add as many toppings as your heart desires.

The concept is clever, but the ice cream is just soft serve with a bunch of toppings mixed in. I didn't think the soft serve was that exciting, more of something you could get from one of those classic ice cream dispensers. The atmosphere is great, friendly staff, etc. it might just be personal preference but I wasn't a huge fan of the ice cream itself.

My friends tried tortas, burritos, not good feedback on either. Stick with the tacos. Even then the tacos are a bit on higher side 2.75 to 3.

They're kind of small but they have lots of filling. It also has many choices of margaritas. The Texas one was about $10. It didn't have any kind of happy hour. The overall meal is way too expensive for what you get. It also has counter order service, but they bring it out to you. That way you pay for it before you eat.

However, I gave it a chance and ordered shrimp and tilapia tacos. I was pleasantly surprised. The tacos were very good! I'd suggest going for taco Tuesday because tacos are under 2 dollars each. It's cheap enough you can experiment and try many kinds! I also like that they give you a free side of salsa. However I thought the guacamole was overpriced at 4 dollars for a small amount of it."", ""The manager on shift was a great guy. He's not the owner, but definitely has the personality to be one!

Taco Loco was just declared similar to Texas street food from an anonymous reviewer. I'll tell you what the dish that was declared the same stuff you get off the streets in Texas. If you order their beef tacos and ask for spicy sauce you will see a comparison to the food you get in Texas to the authentic Mexican food from this restaurant. I would not know this as I have not been to Texas and not experienced any of their food so this must be a huge compliment to the restaurant in general. The girl asked her boyfriend if he would take her back here more often so she could enjoy her home food. He said sure honey we'll come back here soon.Again my husband is praising his steak quesadilla and it was well deserved last night since he hit his bonus at work. So this meal was a celebratory meal for him. He cannot also wait to come back and enjoy more food. I will praise the chips and guac for just being super delicious. It's too bad they couldn't take the tomatoes out for my friend since she can't have them but otherwise it's my favorite appetizer there! I will also go further as to say I enjoyed my carne asada meal and almost got blown away by the poblano pepper!I can officially say that if you are looking for authentic Mexican food or also known for being declared as street favorites from Texas you'll love this place.""]",positive

When I got clarification on the portion I was served, it was the regular menu price/portion because they do not do lunch specials on weekends.

I deducted more stars for the ""spicy shrimp soup"" for which we ordered a small. When it came to the table the scent of fish oil was so strong, it smelled terrible. Then my partner who ordered this dish didn\'t finish because there was just way too much fish oil.

She had been there in the past for lunch and raved about the pesto they had there. My family and I love Italian food, so we were game!- Parking -Center lot. - Vibe - I was surprised to see more of a casual, marketplace type vibe with rustic elements to the decor as compared to the typical Italian restaurant with more of an intimate and fine dining ambiance. You have to be wait to be seated, but the back of the restaurant is an open kitchen with showcase fridges with desserts and other items. There is also a Wine and Beer bar to the left in the back and TVs.- TLC - We had two guys helping us who were both very nice, polite and very attentive. - Eats / Refreshments - Calamari App - lightly breaded, almost looked liked a fried onion ring. It was lightly breaded and the calamari was so tender. It wasn't chewy at all and the marinara sauce that came with it was a nice accompaniment.Linguine frutti di mare - I love seafood so I tend to be drawn to the seafood dishes first at any restaurant. I ordered this dish, but out of all the dishes I tried at the table (Pesto Primavera is the only one I didn't try), unfortunately for me, this was my least favorite. There were only 4 pieces each, of both little neck clams and mussels in their shell, but they were so tiny and barely any meat in them. A skewer of 3 shrimps stood in the center, which were good, but I thought they were slightly ever so slightly overcooked. The linguine itself was great, cooked perfectly al dente and a generous portion of the linguine. Salsiccia Foccacia - Husband ordered this one. It has sausages, red bell peppers and heirloom tomatoes. It's served on a wooden pizza board and it was quite tasty and quite large, so you may want to order this as a shareable item. My husband ended up boxing half of it and took it home. I had some for a snack the next day and it was still great reheated. Tortellini Saporito - My husband's aunt ordered this one and as soon as I took the first bite, I immediately regretted not ordering it for myself. Cheese tortellini is cooked in a truffle parmesan cream sauce with mushrooms and spinach. It. Was. Amazing! It was pretty rich though, so if you're looking for light fare, you might want to change your mind and postpone the light fare for tomorrow! Pasta Primavera - My husband's aunt's friend requested a custom dish and asked for the Pasta Primavera, but with the pesto sauce that my husband's aunt and her both loved. This is the one I did not get to taste! Picture included though. Caesar Salad - I did get to taste the Caesar Salad that had a different twist than the traditional Caesar. It included kale, red cabbage, croutons, topped with black olive powder along with the romaine lettuce as the base, which I thought was interesting and really delicious! Also, big portion!- Kiddos - They offer 5 different dishes on the Kids menu, Chicken Tenders and Fries and 4 pasta dishes. Both of our kids had the Alfredo Penne and it was delicious! The pasta was al dente and the sauce was nice and creamy, same richness as the Tortellini Saporito. The kids meal do not come with a drink or side, but still reasonably priced. It also looked like they had quite a selection of desserts and I was sooooo tempted to get the Tiramisu which is one of my faves, but I literally couldn't eat another bite. Saporito is very generous with their portions, if you didn't get that already having read this far, and since it was only Day 1 of the Hurrication, I needed to pace myself because Hurrication calories are for realz, y'all!"", ""Heard so many great things about this place so we finally made a trip here.

I loved the dressing and the croutons were fresh hot and crispy. You can tell they are made everything in-house. I asked for a extra side of the dressing and I was shocked to see a $1.00 added for maybe 2 tbsp of dressing. So, I insisted that if I would be charged a $1.00 they fill a side sauce container with the Cesar dressing. The dessert that came with the special was called tres milk. It was really good.

During the pandemic and ordering through UberEats, I became the top 5% of customers according to the app. Last night may be the last time I ever order here. I ordered pickup and then called about 15 minutes later to ask when my food would be ready. I had to repeat my name and order info several times to get an answer which was - ""everything would be ready in 5 minutes"". I hurried on over for my pickup. When I got there I noticed 2 of the 4 front of house employees were serving without masks during a Covid variant surge and the continued mask mandate. I can only assume that those in the back preparing the food do not wear masks. As I picked my bag up I felt through the heavily stapled shut paper bag to make sure my items were there, it felt right so I went on my way. When I got home, we unpacked everything and noticed right away there was no added baggie with bean sprouts, basil, jalapeno and hoisin/hot sauce. We had TWO orders of pho and this is a major part of the dish. Such a major disappointment. I called to let them know, and they said ""Oh yeah, sorry, we are so busy. You can drive back"". Obviously I did not want to drive back over when I wanted to eat my food fresh and hot. The apology wasn\'t sincere and there was no other option other than to drive back. I mean at least offer a discount or something on my next order. With there being a half dozen other pho options within a mile, I will be moving on and become a regular elsewhere. This was a very unfortunate incident.', 'Just a quick update! They closed their cart on SE 82nd so we went for our favorite Crispy Fried Chicken Egg Noodle Soup at their NE Freemont location.

Located in an unassuming location, we happened on this coz most of the restaurants were either not open or were not offering dine in options. This restaurant had both take out and dine in options. For a group of 5 people with small kids and on the road, dine in seemed to be a more feasible option. The restaurant was extremely clean and they were following all the social distancing norms. We ordered the following : Classic chicken pho, Vermicelli bowl with grilled chicken and tofu, steamed rice bowl with stir fry vegetables and tofu, vegetable fried rice, vegetable rolls and iced tea.

Their food quality is fresh, reasonably priced, and tastes tremendously delicious. I'm impressed with their flavor in addition to their promptness in-regards of getting everything brought out within an appropriate amount of time. We had a party of 7, and I felt the business handled it very well. The service did not feel compromised and neither did the food. We had a few orders of pho, two rice plates, one jumping beef over eggs plate, and another dish that were noodles.. all were delicious. They were brought out hot and all at the same time so everybody could enjoy their meal together. I'm not particularly sure how much the bill was, but the most experience item we ordered was the jumping beef ($15).

I ordered the shaken beef with egg meat cake. The meat was soft and the pickled veggies was ok. They gave me a sweet soy sauce for dipping instead of the traditional lemon salt pepper dip. My bf ordered the flying beef plate that comes with either bread or rice. The dish comes on a hot plate and it was honestly dissapointing. The steak is cut thin so it was overcooked and rubbery. The pate was just a little portion and fried egg. The onions were raw instead of cooked so it wasn't that great for the price point as well. My cousin got the pho Tai which is rare slice beef.

I like how the game menu is categorized."", ""It's different from other board game cafes I've been to; first the whole inside ambiance is very rustic with dim lighting giving it a very nice cozy feeling. Next each table has a little bell you can call a server which is nice especially if you are in the middle of a game and you don't want to be distracted trying to flag down a server.When you book a reservation they need the number of guests because they have a special menu for games that cater to a certain number of players which I think is an amazing and smart idea. They also have a game master available if you have any questions, but the servers were also very knowledgable with gameplay. The games all have a wooden box container to make give it a fine wine kind of vibe which I thought was cute and quirky.The reason I had to knock off a star is due to the food ordering. So they have a deal of ordering 3 dishes and you get $3 off. You think simple right? No, there is no writing on the menu or explanation from the staff that you MUST tell the server that you are doing this deal which I think is silly needing to DECLARE it and the next is you have to order to the multiples of 3 dishes all in one go. Besides that annoyance, I think overall the food was inexpensive and delicious. I like that it comes in smaller portions so you try a little bit of everything. I had the mushroom kingdom burger, fries, pretzel bites, and cookies (remember to order at least 20 minutes before leaving since it takes time to bake).

There are also a bunch of food and drink options you can order! Currently, because of Covid, they only seat outdoors which is unfortunate because there are really only three tables.

The Mac was soooo tasty.', 'I wager the place is ""understaffed,"" as the first thing greeting you is an empty host stand. \xa0When the host finally appeared, she could not triage a pick-up order to someone else in order to address a request for seating, which means that is not in the training manual to differentiate.Then when the host showed up and we requested outdoor seating, I was told, ""uh it\'ll be a 2 hour wait."" \xa0You look around and half the restaurant is empty, but the bar is full and tables have happy eaters. \xa0We are, plainly, not doing the deceitful artifice of social distancing (hence a full bar). \xa0So the explanation for such a wait must lay at staffing, which lays at the foot of the franchise.Besides telling me about the ""wait,"" she is plainly lying. \xa0 We sit at open seats at the bar (which the hostess does not even suggest as an option when telling us about the wait); people are immediately sat at tables throughout my stay. \xa0Amazing. \xa0So the hostess is a) a liar or b) terrible at estimating waits, and c) not attempting whatsoever to keep us in the restaurant.

Entering the restaurant, Pluckers Club members do not check in with the app anymore. You are instructed to do it with your server.

Today, I didn't need it at all, I was told to scan the code on my bill. WTF? Is this new? Is the app even necessary anymore? Problem with scanning the receipt is you can't scan it right away because everything isn't thru their system; this means you not only have to hang on to your receipt, you also have to remember to scan it for points (within 48 hrs too!). I believe the restaurant is just being lazy if this is their new policy.I waited at my table 13 minutes before being acknowledged and the table did not have a drink menu.My server couldn't remember the specifics from my order and had to return repeatedly for the information.

She then took their plastic covered menus in those same hands and coughed again in their direction. I watched her walk into the prep area coughing and use the cash register! Same unsanitized hands! Yes, after that several other workers waited on line to use the cash register. No gloves. In essence she has contaminated the whole restaurant and visitors. Luckily I recently recovered from COVID and have had a booster, but others may not be so lucky.', ""I have always had good meals at Saltgrass. \xa0Last night the facility seemed old and dirty. \xa0We had to wait about an hour even though they said 20 min. \xa0I ordered a simple chopped steak med well and it came out like a briquette and the plate looked like a kids meal. \xa0My wife ordered range rattlers and had half of one and told me that it tasted bad. \xa0I tried the shrimp and it tasted like it was spoiled or had been sitting out for days. \xa0We were with a guest so we didn't complain. I hope it was a one time event. \xa0The server was courteous and we will try again but I was very unhappy this location had such a bad night.."", ""Reasonably priced steakhouse.. but read on and don't believe the menu. I've always liked Saltgrass as a reasonably priced steakhouse that offers a friendly and comfortable environment. That continues based on first post pandemic stop. BUT I had an all time unique restaurant failure there tonight. Got there early and ordered a 10 oz rib eye on the before 6pm menu section priced at $19.95. Partner had salmon Salmon was small, burned and dry. Portion of fries was huge as was the up charged onion strings. Waitress didn't know extra cost in lieu of salad. My rib eye was thin but tasty. The baked potato and salad and bread were good.Waitress asked three times if we wanted $9 cake slice! HOWEVER when the bill came I noticed the rib eye was priced at $ 21.95, $2 above the menu price. Not a huge difference but I had to ask. The waitress, confirmed I was right with a look at the menu. She went to have it corrected and I thought I'll give her an extra $2 tip. But she returned with news the menu was wrong as price had increased . What?? Now $2 isn't a big deal, \xa0but the Principle of a menu price not being honored was probably a restaurant low for me! My only choice was now to lower the tip! Unfair to waitress? Yes! But who would want to work there . Sad to see such a fine place stoop so low. Avoid it !"", ""Was given a gift certificate (GC) in 2014 (seriously) so decided it was finally time to try Saltgrass with a family member. \xa0First thing which hit me on menu was extremely high calorie count on virtually all salads. \xa0We ordered the 9 Oz filet, Caesar salad, and grilled chicken sandwich. \xa0The food review is as follows:Caesar had entirely too much dressing (I quickly realized why all salads have high calorie count), brought out 6 Oz filet even though we ordered 9 Oz (waiter offered to take it back and recook steak?), was quite marbly which made us believe it wasn't truly a filet, and chicken sandwich was average and a bit on dry side. \xa0We thought about ordering the carrot cake but it comes in at a whopping 1,900 calories so we passed. \xa0Overall, everything was just below average from food and service but since it was paid for with GC, we did not made an issue of trying to fool us with smaller steak and too much dressing on salad - hard pass on any future visits to Saltgrass."", ""We ordered Via Uber Eats \xa0 Food ordered chicken friend steak green beans and mash with a side salad \xa0and carrot cake for dessert Food was delivered HOT large portions and great taste !

"[""I couldn't recommend this establishment enough. I had an absolutely phenomenal time and if I were from Boston, without a doubt, I would be a regular. Where do I even start, the service was top notch exceptional, the wine smooth and savory, the food was mouth watering (the best ribeye and Tiramisu I've had) and the environment was fun, chill and classy, all at once! Some food recommendations: Order the meatballs for an appetizer. The meat was unbelievably tender and the sauce was so delicious that I had the rest of it alone like a soup. For an entrée, you can't go wrong with pasta but the ribeye was JUST RIGHT, flavorful, tender and super juicy. Finally, dessert, Tiramisu or cheesecake. The Tiramisu tasted like it was made in Italy (the only one that I've had that has measured up to the one I had abroad) and the cheesecake was so tasty, I was taken aback. If you're looking for some great Italian food or some really good steak, this is the place to visit!"", ""Food was okay. But there was a table of 6 women who we're legitimately screaming the entire time. We were only there for an hour and 45 minutes and it was miserable. I'm not kidding, they were screaming the entire time. Ruined my friends and I's Christmas dinner. Probably won't return, they also checked the bill on our table several times while we had full drinks. Seemed rude. The wait staff encouraged these women screaming and drinking incessantly. It was miserable.One table sat down next to us and then left immediately saying it was too loud and obnoxious. A family behind us spent about 30 min there and got out as quickly as they could. And upon leaving I said good luck to a table still there and they commented as well on how annoying and terrible those ladies were making their evening."", ""There seems to be an infinite amount of Italian restaurants in Boston, so during our short trip here, my boyfriend and I tried to find the best one. And we succeeded! From the food to the service, this restaurant was exceptional. I will forever remember my unbelievable dining experience here. The restaurant itself is small and cozy. It felt like you were eating at a family dinner party with everyone passing by greeting you with the friendliest and warmest smiles-- something that made our dining experience all the better!Onto the food!! We started off with the Calamari Fritti, Polpette della Nonna, and Gamberi con Limoncello. This was the best calamari I've ever had. It was fried to a perfect crisp-- not too heavy and not too light. The tender calamari meat absorbed the spices and the lemony sauce was paired to perfection! The Polpette was literally the best meatball ever, sitting in deliciously rich red tomato sauce. And the final appetizer, the Gamberi, was the perfect texture shrimp that embodied the ideal balance of salty, sweet, and succulent. For the entrees, I have never had anything like the Ossu Buco-- it was a life-changing meat based entree. It was a perfectly seasoned pillow of pork, resting on a duvet of aromatic sauce. And the Bistec was the perfect medium temperature steak with a crispy char on the outside and tender melt in your mouth meat on the inside. The fries paired very well with the steak too! Overall, this was a 11/10 dining experience.If you ever find yourself in Boston struggling to decide on a good Italian place, worry no more! Just come here for an immaculate dining experience paired with the best service the restaurant industry has ever seen."", ""Best dinner in years! \xa0The food was amazing, the staff warm and inviting and the view so quaint and north end. \xa0I can't wait to go back again."", ""Heard great things about Arya and decided to check it out. The setting here feels like something out of a movie. It's upstairs in a smaller, dimly lit, and intimate space and we had an unforgettable time. Our waiter was quick with drink and dinner specials and was very attentive the whole night despite the place being packed.The food was superb. We started with Mamma Rosalie's Meatballs. They were hot, tender, and the San Marzano tomato sauce tasted excellent and like it was made with love. I ordered the Gnocchi con Aragosta, a fantastic homemade pasta dish with rich, creamy truffle and fontina cheese. The potato gnocchi was delicate, and the bit of Maine lobster accompanying it was fresh and not overcooked.Last not but not least we tried the Frutti di Mare. I absolutely loved the spicy white wine broth and I thought the scallops were some of the best I've had. Anyway, make a reservation and check this place out, it's one of the best in the North End and busy for a reason."", ""Great spot in the north end! You definitely need a reservation because it is very small inside, and chances are you will see some NBA players! The staff at the restaurant couldn't be nicer and more welcoming.

We went with the tasting menu ($65/pp)If you are looking for a variety of flavors, would highly recommend the tasting menu. The food wouldn\'t stop coming. The price is steep, but you get A LOT of food. Our favorites included the calamari fritti, burrata, shrimp scampi, and the steak. Burrata tasted so good and fresh and the fried calamari was perfect in taste and texture. The steak was seriously fantastic and by far my favorite. The scallops and halibut were more naturally flavored- with just some salt and pepper but the halibut was a bit bland (and skin soggy and fatty) while the scallops seemed almost undercooked \xa0but too charred and bitter on the outside. We were ""eh"" about the clam spaghetti, halibut and scallops- not bad but likely wouldn\'t order them again. Our waiter Matt was great and gave helpful recommendations and advice, including for the local Italian bread bakery nearby.Overall, a fine experience with high highs.

We did the option where the chefs pick 2 appetizers, a pasta, and 2 entrees. So good and the portions were perfect!! You will never leave here hungry. They had a bottle of red wine called Roxanne as part of the table setting and we just went with it. No regrets-it was delicious.

Japanese Curry: this should be revisited. They used too much water which making it too runny and lost a ton of flavor. I was disappointed I could eat it with my chicken katsu or my rice.2.

My wife always orders the Veggie Stir Fry rice bowl with tofu - when you find a dish you enjoy, stick with it! Other family members have ordered and enjoyed the noodle bowl option as well.

"['Awesome Steakhouse! \xa0My recent trip to visit family in southern Washington we had dinner here twice (2 & 9 January, 2022). \xa0I read about this establishment online ""Best Steakhouse\'s in Portland."" Our first visit was awesome so we had to go a second time. \xa0Amongst 10 steakhouses evaluated in the article Sayler\'s was ranked #6. \xa0Laurelhurst Market was #1 and Morton, The Steakhouse was #10. \xa0During recent trips to Portland, OR I did try the #9 (Fogo De Chao) and the #7 (Clydes Prime Rib Restaurant) and I would agree that Sayler\'s has earned its spot at #6 probably because of its quality cuts at a very, very reasonable price. \xa0The flip-side, you can find other articles that move the ranking around and here\'s where Sayler\'s ranked: Trip Advisor it\'s ranked #2 out of 15; Eater Portland, OR its ranked #9 of 9; Kev\'s Best its ranked 5 of 5 and lastly, Foursquares.com ranked Sayler\'s #3 out of 11. \xa0This Restaurant knows how to do Steaks and its likely more reasonable then the other Steakhouses. \xa0 \xa0 The 16 oz. Prime Rib is the winner for me, hands down! \xa0I did have the 20 oz. T-Bone during my second visit, which was excellent but from now on it\'s Prime Rib for me! \xa0The other patrons in my party ordered the Filet Minon and New York strip which was also excellent. \xa0The menu also offers other items such entrees as chicken, seafood, etc and you can add a seafood item to your steak or prime rib dinner.  \xa0 \xa0 The Restaurant may not look fancy and the inside decor maybe more from the 90\'s but HEY, did I mention the Prime Rib! \xa0There\'s plenty of parking and they do not take reservations. \xa0The two times we went there it was a Sunday (early evening) and it was busy BUT the Staff and Servers who are very attentive did move customers through pretty quick. \xa0The Staff is friendly and it appeared that their were at least two to three Hostesses that seated customers. \xa0The two Servers that we had during both visits were very friendly, attentive and took really good care of us. \xa0They were really efficient in taking our orders and making sure we had everything we needed prior to feasting. \xa0Dessert there\'s only ice cream but there\'s something like 5-8 flavors to choose from which is just fine with me. \xa0 \xa0 This is my #1 Steakhouse in Portland until further notice. \xa0Until next time, Aloha, be safe and always tip your Servers.', ""Once again, a beautiful meal at Sayler's. Crisp veggies and onion rings for appetizer, garlic bread, 6 ounce filet med rare, baked potato, and peppermint ice cream. No greater combo but nothing was really hot. My friend and I arrived at 6 with a very short wait time of 10 minutes with not even half of the restaurant full. In other words it was a slow night. The first onion ring was not even hot. It was sort of medium warm but not fresh 'out of the oil' hot. My potato was not steaming nor did they deliver my steak with that classic sizzle on the plate. (Although the table of 4 seated next to us received four sizzling plates of food)My ice cream did not even have the roundedness of a full scoop.

No real outstanding dishes that I've had yet but again, a decent place to get your dim sum fix."", 'My experience at this establishment was just absolutely horrible, where can I even begin.First of all, we scheduled a table for us at 12 and even gave them the courtesy of arriving 10 minutes before so that they can get everything set up for us. To my surprise, they just gave us a number and told us to wait. We ended up waiting for around 30-45 minutes, I was even contemplating leaving but my discord kitten told me that we should just wait. After we finally got our number called, we had to navigate through this organized maze of tables and I was bumped into people both sitting and standing. After we got our menus, we figured out what we wanted to order but to our surprise, another 20 minutes goes by and no-one is taking our order, we even asked many different waitresses walking by but they either ignored us or said ok and just left. We finally had a waitress ask if were ready and we finally got our orders. This is only the beginning of my horrible experience.My main problem comes from the lack of attention that the waitresses give to you. I was extremely parched from not drinking water for the day so we asked the waitress for some water. She said ok and scoffed for some reason like did I offend you? Maybe 10 minutes go by and no water. She goes by serving others and we ask her again for water and she responded with a ""ok just wait"". Like are you kidding, just grab me the pitcher literally over there and bring it. We end up asking 8 or 9 times to around 5 different people and they all either said ok or just ignored us. Then our food came out, yes before the water. The fish there was just nothing but bones and tasted like a burnt tire. The short ribs looked gross but were actually pretty good. The bbq pork buns were a solid choice, had much better before but they were just ok. The shrimp dim sum was actually really good so good job on making my experience just a little bit better. The noodles were also just ok, tastes like something I make drunk at 2 a.m when I have an apetite for anything. Finally I decide that I am too thirsty and I keep asking the waitresses again where my water was. My discord kitten actually went up to the kitchen where the waitresses were and asked for the water and you know what the waitress did that was absolutely disgusting. She told her to get back to her table and move out of the way, actually going out of her way to grab my kitten by the shoulders and shoving her onto the table. I could have this place sued for assault but luckily I was just too kind.This place was horrible, too loud, too packed, waitresses who are disgustingly rude, food that is mediocre at best, prices were also not worth the experience. We ended up leaving without tipping because this place is just a horrible experience and I hope that anyone with a single brain cell left in them would have the ability to decide not to go here.

If you can overlook this book\'s cover, Golden Swan is still a recommend.', 'Portions of dumplings/ chicken feet/ shumai here are actually huge, probably 2x as big as what I expect from dimsum. The congee and rice noodles are more normal portions. Per the rule (and especially because the sizes are huge), 2-3 orders per person is good.', 'It\'s the first time I\'ve been to this restaurant. Parents wanted to go for dim sum around this area, and since we\'ve been to West Lake many times, it\'s time to try something different- but not really different...Like West lake across the street, it\'s probably one of the oldest dim sum places in all of greater Vancouver. And the little trolly karts give it more of a vintage vibe.This place is easy to find on Victoria St, with its wide and colorful storefront. Unfortunately, parking isn\'t always easy. There are only a few designated spots up front, and even those were hard to back into. Street parking is available but not abundant.The layout of the restaurant is typical/ classic, spacious, and wide open. Since covid started, many restaurants separate customers with plastic sheets of dividers, these guys simply gave you space between each table with wide walkways. Which is kinda nice.It\'s a more traditional dim sim place, so their focus was not on the ""FUSION/ \xa0fancy"" stuff, but rather their staple dishes, the har gao, siu mai, chicken feet etc. We got those and a few other items.They do everything quite well, flavor was mostly well balanced and the portions were good. Nothing crazy big west lake, but generous. Nothing I can complain about.I think it\'s because the majority of their customers are seniors, the servers and waitresses seem to be very patient and polite. Service was surprisingly good, considering how busy they are.Great experience overall.

Portion sizes (huge portions, and to be fair it's reflected in the ever slightly higher than average price point, 100% worth in my opinion) 3.

We started with a latte with oat milk and a mexican hot chocolate - both were SUPER delicious. Next, we shared the pastry basket - we were afraid that the pastries would be dried out/boring but it was a great decision to get it! We had an earl grey scone, some type of apricot brioche, and a white chocolate/raspberry pastry. They all tasted delicious - a must!! Next we had the breakfast tacos and beans on toast. According to the cook, the beans on toast was super popular and was his favorite dish - we can also attest that it was delicious. The breakfast tacos were a little spicy, but also refreshing, and not too heavy. Yum! Would definitely come back."", ""did not expect to be raving about breakfast.

"[""I wanted to love this place, but honestly aside from the red snapper my husband ordered, and my sisters rice and beans everything left much to be desired.

We ordered our food, my sis and I ordered the same thing (fufu relleno) my sister was brought something completely different. The mashed plantains lacked flavor even with the creole sauce on top (like some garlic) and the shrimp was overcooked it was very soft, the red snapper was great very crispy and tasted fresh, the grilled octopus was also good, the drinks were good but we were left waiting for them for a while and we kept asking for them, we did not check the receipt for how many drinks we asked for so I hope we werent charged for drinks we never got. Overall, I can make the same food at home with more flavor as I am Puerto Rican. I thought the food would have more flavor and be fresh especially for the price.

The crispy bacon was oh so good -- we only wished there were more than the 1 piece. Also really liked the potato wedges.

None of us ever tried Slavic food, but I've only tried Russian dish few times.My family and I came here around 6:40, and the tables were full of customers waiting for their food. We were kind of annoyed that food took around 40 minutes or longer to come. Regardless of the wait times, it was so worth waiting though. Somehow we didn't even get bread until we almost finished eating.We had Meat Platter (2people $38.95), Carbonara ($16.95) and Zlatiborski Goulash ($17.95) and they were all yummy. When it comes to Meat Platter, it was so big that none of us could finish it. Pork chops, chicken and sausage were fresh and tasty. It was interesting how this dish came with plain and red pepper butter. I personally think it was good enough without butter; and the butter was home made and tasty. Carbonara was perfect. Pasta was nicely cooked, and it was tasty. Goulash had big chunks of meat and some veggies along with rice and mashed potatoes. Goulash was SO good. Home made breads were VERY impressive as well.Service was attentive and friendly. We noticed the owner interacting to our next table, and some customers were Russians and Serbians. Because some customers were Russians and Serbians this restaurant knows how to cook Eastern European food well. Just that I felt very thirsty after eating and had to drink so much water. I better go back to try either Schntzel, Roulade or Cabbage Rolls, and it was an awesome experience trying Serbian food."", ""Authentic and delicious traditional East European dishes loaded with ingredients and flavours! I've never tried food from the Balkan region. It reminded me of Greek food but not quite. They are really good with their meat. We had chicken, pork and lamb. The portion was big and the pricing was fair.The soup of the day was made of chicken, carrots, green peas and potatoes. The flavour was homey and satisfying. The soup wasn't watery but full of contents.The pork schnitzel was this gigantic log which is crispy on the outside and filled with pork tenderloin and cheese. Cutting through it and seeing the cheese flowing out of it was amusing. The roasted potatoes were well seasoned and the pickled cabbage was refreshing and gave you a break from the cheesy meat taste.My favourite out of all in this dinner was the roasted lamb. They were so tender and moist. It fell right off the bone. The creamy sauce compliments the meat! Loved the rice and roasted vegetables on the dish.The flatbread was yummy and dry the way it is. It goes well with any sauce or simply on its own.The baklava dessert was traditional and unique. I found it a tad too sweet but I could taste the grind walnut and appreciate the honey within it.This little cozy restaurant has a good vibe and ambience of East Europe. The server was very sweet and helped packing the leftover. However, when I opened the leftover the next day, I noticed that half of the 1.5 leftover flatbread was not packed. It puzzled me and perhaps I should go back and order some more!"", ""It's been a long time since I went to Tenen and surprisingly the pricing hasn't changed much. They have shown up frequently on Groupon, however, and with their clever pricing, the $20-towards-lunch adds up to either a cheap yet huge-portioned lunch for one person, or approximately a half-priced lunch for two persons.They do have nearly-$20 main dishes so going solo with the groupon is fine (and it's one groupon per table) but most items are $16.95.Overall the food is comfort homestyle food. Actually on the mediocre side except the portion per plate is probably good enough for up to two persons depending on what you get and your appetite. Tenen does feed you well and isn't skimpy on portions. Even though they have the usual fillers of bread and potatoes, they aren't stingy with the meat.Gourmet Burger ($16.95) 10 oz. patty with bacon and cheese mixed in-Looks like the bread used is a pita sliced in half and pan fried in drippings from the burger.-The seared-on-the-outside patty itself is really heavy and filling, but it's also really kind of rubbery-firm from maybe having ground the meat too finely. It has the feel of an overdone burger patty.-The burger has some cheese, bacon, and chili mixed in for a slight bit of bite to the flavour.-The plate has fries, coleslaw, and a scoop of rich chili-flavoured spreading cheese which you can certainly slather inside the burger.The patty is big enough for this burger to count as two regular burgers that might each cost you $10-$12 elsewhere. It's a very plain burger (bread and patty) but the plate is not skimpy on portions even if you discount the complimentary thick pita that comes to the table.Cabbage Rolls (16.95) seasoned ground beef and pork with rice, stuffed in sauerkraut leaves, served with mashed potato-Looks like a small portion at just two rolls, but the amount of rice in the filling is token, so you're getting basically two burgers worth of meat here. If you're still not feeling full enough you can work in the pita bread that comes to the table.-Overall tasted fine, nothing superlative here. The slight sourness of the sauerkraut really helps with how filling this plate is.OK food with bonus points for generous portions -- something that is steadily harder to find nowadays, especially with newer restaurants."", ""We were looking for a little something different to eat and I stumbled upon Tenen in my search. It's an Eastern Europe restaurant specializing in Balkan cuisine; mainly Serbian dishes but there seems to be some Russian influence too.We made reservations for a Saturday evening (7:00pm) and luckily we did because it was busy. It got even busier at night because there was a live band that started playing at 9:15pm. No idea if this is a weekend thing but it was fun and lively.

There's also a Tuesday special for 10 chevapi ($11.95) along with a few daily specials to round things out.- Veal ragout soup ($6.95) - hearty veal and vegetable soup served with corn bread. It also came with two pieces of their homemade bread (lepina). Hearty flavour and the bread had a satisfying, chewy bite. - Tenen meat platter ($38.95 for 2 people) - chevapi, chicken shish kebab, pork cutlet, chicken thigh, bacon and sausage. It also came with roasted potatoes, coleslaw, lepina, kaymak (cheese) and urnebes (cheese and hot chili peppers). The chevapi, chicken thigh and sausage were all tender and bursting with flavour. Unfortunately, the pork cutlet was dry and overcooked. Same for the bacon and chicken shish kebab, although to a lesser extent. Still, it's a massive platter and can easily feed three people. - Leskovački uštipci ($16.95) - this was one of their specials. Beef and pork meat with melted cheese topped with red onion, over roasted potatoes and coleslaw. The meat was fantastic. The texture was spot on but the taste reminded me of seafood for some reason.

"[""My friend and I have been craving Korean food the past week and so we tried our luck and checked out Chosun. *** Even though there was only one waitress working the lunch hour, the customer service was phenomenal. The restaurant was already pretty busy with different sized parties here and there but we got seated, drinks served, and amicable service throughout by the server, Tori was her name. We ordered the seafood pancake, bossam, and Jaeyook bokkum followed with an array of traditional Korean side dishes. Pleased to say everything was well seasoned, flavorful, and served in great time (hardly any wait). Me and my friend really enjoyed all the dishes and our cravings were most definitely satisfied :) I've never been a fan of having to wait ages just to get the bill or maybe get a to-go box but once again, excellent customer service by Tori who had it ready for us beforehand and given at an appropriate time. If you ever want a good meal, great service, and a fun time - definitely worth checking out! (And also definitely wanting our dining experience with Tori again!)"", ""Chosun is a Korean bbq place where you can bbq your own food but as for us we didn't chose to do that. We chose to have to kitchen prepare our food. I know. It's part of the experience but to each his own. Not much ambiance but it's all about the food here. We really love Korean food. We ordered jab chae which was clear noodle with vegetables. It was really good. We always order jab chae whenever we go to Korean. The jab chae give us the standard of the Korean food. So it's was right on. Also, got the yangnyum galbi which is Korean short ribs. Loved it. It was so good. The Bulgogi was so tender and very tasty. Really enjoyed this too. And lastly, we got the bi bim bob. Another staple for our Korean food. Mix it up, cut up the fried egg and it was so good. Loved all of it. Very good Korean food. So this was a really good Korean food place. Bbq yourself or have the kitchen cook it. Either way it's good. Great food. Great Korean food. Decent service cause they are so busy with a huge waiting line. So if you like Korean food and in Austin, give it a try. It's very good. We enjoyed it."", ""Their seafood pancake had a variety of seafood in it and green onions, it was crispy but would have preferred it if it was a bit crispier (It was still good). Their tofu soup was great and I ordered it with an egg (which was extra) and it was my favorite from this restaurant.Their Banchan was ok and they did not give much. The service was alright. They had a lot of customers at the time so that was understandable but sometimes when we would ring the bell they would take a long time to come and we would have to get up and try to get someone's attention."", ""Clean environment, decent service, solid but pricey food. I loved the seafood pancake!! The breading had the perfect crunchy to moist ratio, and there was a fair amount of seafood mixed in (though I'd prefer more). For bbq, we tried the pork belly, plain galbi, and marinated galbi. Meat quality seemed good, and the cuts were clean. Though the marinated galbi was unevenly marinated- some parts tasted entirely plain.I took off a star because side dishes were kind of disappointing, marinated galbi was lacking in flavor, and prices were pretty high relative to comparable kbbq options.There was plentiful parking. We arrived at about 8:30pm on a Friday and had a 30 minute wait time."", ""Came with a big group of 20 so it was a bit chaotic with the staff who had trouble remembering all our orders..

The most disappointing was the ban chan. Just 4 dishes (usually places offer double).

Some of these reviewers criticizing the service of this great local restaurant would do well to remember that everyone is shorthanded right now. Give them a break.', ""Awful experience. When we arrived there were about three tables seated and the entire restaurant was empty on a Saturday evening at 5 PM. This should have been our first clue that this would not have been such a pleasant experience. As we were seated at our table for a party of six. No one came to acknowledge us being at the restaurant. After 8 minutes, I rang the bell to request our server. Three minutes go by and a nice server came out to inform us that they needed to move us to a new table as there was a reservation for this table. Let me remind you, at this point there was still only three tables other than ours in the restaurant. We move and its not a big issue. As our food comes we notice that the banchan is pretty small in quantity for the amount of people that we have. We finish what was provided and request more while eating three portions of bbq, one big hot pot and multiple appetizers. A new server comes and states that we cannot have more kimchi as we have already had a refill. I asked if it was possible to even pay for more kimchi and his response was to roll his eye and walk to the back. The amount of kimchi we got was enough for each person to have one piece. It's weird that kimchi, a staple for a Korean meal, was not provided with the amount of food ordered. Overall, food was mediocre at best, overpriced, and the service was atrocious. I will not be going back. I would highly recommend going to Korea House (10 min away) as opposed to this place."", 'I stopped by here a couple days ago after craving Korean food. The food was excellent and quite filling. The staff was friendly and nice to talk with. The place was clean and there is a lot of parking. The hours are good for a restaurant. They have take-out, curbside pick-up as well as dine in.The menu is quite good and offers a variety of Korean food including different meats and several different soups. I had the so galbi (beef ribs) grilled on the table in front of me. I have spent many years in Korea and the taste was authentic. The side dishes that come with the order were delicious as well and many.The only negative things I could say are the price (a little expensive) and the service. The service was mediocre although the staff was friendly and nice when they came by.Overall, the experience was good and I want to thank Chosun Korean BBQ for making Austin home and for being a good neighbor.']",negative

As someone who's really sensitive to smell, I didn't like the smell, but I figured it was probably a temporary thing due to the number of people congregating in the foyer / hostess desk. I went straight to the bar, which was pretty busy, but I found myself a bar stool. The bartenders were nice, but they're definitely super busy.

"['Came here to dine in but forgot to write a review. Tonight was my second time dining in and both times, I had a wonderful experience.There were a ton of togo orders as we walked in! We were worried that our food would take a while since we were pretty hangry but luckily they served each item when it was ready (as opposed to waiting for everything to be ready for serving). We got a spicy tuna hand roll, salmon skin hand roll, unagi, yellowtail, miso yaki salmon, karaage, and mixed yakitori combo. Everything was so good. The sushi and hand rolls were excellent.We were going to order the mango soju and a glass of wine but our waitress warned us that the soju would be enough for the two us of. Glad she warned us because it was HUGE!', ""came here for mostly cooked sushi and pleasant surprise, their portion size are HUGE!! very fresh and if you order anything deep fried or with tempura, it's super crunchy!!!we ordered calamari with octopus legs and they came out super fresh and crunchy!! could not stop eating! the spicy mayo dipping sauce is perfect!we also ordered California dream, crusty philly salmon, red lobster and Beaverton. \xa0California dream was deep fried crab salad and spicy tuna that we asked for well done..it was super crunchy and crispy, so good!Red lobster roll was super delicious and their portion size are all so big!! 2 of us could not finish we had to call for someone to come help finish (literally called his phone) and still had some to take home to his wife.Check came out to be about $53-55 for feeding 4 adults, and again the portion sizes are huge and filling, very worthwhile! \xa0they have a lot more other options including sashimi and udon and ramen. Need to check out their tempura ice cream and cheesecake menu next time. \xa0We were too full to explore any further but 10/10 would come here again!"", ""The problem is that this place is inconsistent. One day it's good and another time it's hard, rough, and dry (like today). We always order the same things: bento boxes with bulgogi, tonkatsu, or salmon.Another thing is that the containers of the sauces were inside the bento boxes. That means the containers may not be sanitary on the outside. If they put the container sauces OUTSIDE of the bent box, it would be more sanitary."", ""Great lunch here at Shoten! Service was friendly and the space is nicely decorated but not overdone. It was dim and quiet when we went for lunch around 1:30 pm. The rolls are huge! Our server tried to warn us, but we didn't listen! 3 rolls and a bento box were way more than necessary! We tried the chicken karaage for an appetizer, but I didn't like that too much. Everything else was super yummy and I'll for sure be back!"", ""We have been here several times and haven't even taken friends with us. The service is great even when they're busy. Their prices are reasonable and their portions are sizable. My favorite is the Hawaiian poke salad and the rainbow roll. My husband loves the Friday oysters or the bacon wrapped scallops."", ""Shoten is everything you want and need out of a Japanese restaurant. Even better it's located right in the heart of the Portland metro area. I used to crave an authentic Japanese experience without going downtown. Shoten is the spot.

I love sitting at the sushi bar!', 'Before the pandemic, I went there for lunch and they were always busy. \xa0Decent service, and they gave you a lot of food. \xa0Lunch combo was always good, so you can try from bento style to sashimi. During the pandemic, we like to pick some sashimi and hand rolls for lunch and add some appetizers for dinner such sbbacon wrapped scallops. Or chicken karaage.

"[""I've seen a few mixed reviews from this place but to be honest, I liked it!The food was delicious, the water tasted filtered so that made me incredibly happy(Florida tap water is horrific! )The restaurant was clean and service was friendly.The only issue I had was the lunch menu used to have papads (Papadum's) included on their menu option but it has been crossed out on all of the menus and they charge $4 a basket for them. I was sad by this but nonetheless we still ordered them. Lunch deals range from $10-14 and it's incredibly filling. I would definitely visit again and be aware, at the time of this review, there's a small discount through the Yelp app when you check in:) Enjoy!"", ""AC (After COVID changed everything) update!Buffet is back, just as good as before. It's saying something when I, a lover of meat, went back for seconds on the vegetarian items (dal mahkani which is my #2 favorite dish behind saag paneer) and a curried cabbage with green beans and peppers. Still only complaint is the cramped table layout but not much they can do with the space."", ""Well, I wish the food matched the service and the overall vibe of the restaurant. My hunny is not big on trying new places or ethnic foods so I saved wanting to go here for my birthday. Walking in - the place looks very clean and trendy. We were approached right away and service started immediately -off to a great start. I ordered a mango lassi which was ok. They only have beer and wine - neither of which I'm a fan of - but I was excited to try the food. It's been over two years since I had Indian food so food was my priority not my normal martinis. My man ordered a Legend \xa01000 beer which he stated was ok/good. It was a large bottle ( 2 glasses) for $10 which that price seems pretty good considering other prices at our normal places. The lassi was $5 which is also a fair price. Here comes the food and this is where what started as a 5 star review goes down fast. We ordered the Saffron Mix Platter. As soon as the waiter put it down - ( you will see the picture) I was concerned that it looked very overcooked which it was. One of the appetizers was good but sadly rest of the platter was not enjoyable. I had ordered garlic naan ( bread) but when our food came before the naan - we asked for it but the waiter said we didn't order it -but I had - they did bring a naan within a minute and he did apologize saying something I couldn't understand but at least he acknowledged it was his mistake. A minute later another guy brought another naan and we showed we already had it - so not sure what happened there but unfortunately as you will see from the pic it was so charred - I had one bite and proceeded to the food. I don't like burnt food. The chicken tikka was so dry - the flavor coating was good but the chicken was without any moisture so totally overcooked. Thankfully the chicken Xacutti was very good. The presentation of all the food was very nice but sadly I can't recommend this place based on my experience of only one food item being enjoyable. It was my birthday and I didn't even want to try dessert as I was so disappointed with what we had ate."", ""Came here based on other's reviews and agree that the food was authentic and delicious. We started with the potato tiki appetizer which was a little more breaded than we like but definitely flavorful. We decided to go with one of the chef's specials instead of our usual tikka masala. The chicken chettinad was something different compared to other Indian restaurants but had the perfect combination of spices and heat. Enjoyed the matar paneer which was very creamy but paneer seemed like it was pre made instead of fresh. If you're an IPA snob don't waste your time with the Indian IPA."", ""Haven't been in a while. Its like visiting an old friend and catching up right where you left off."", ""This is one of our regular weekend lunch spots and the food never disappoints. \xa0The lunch is served buffet style. \xa0Perfect for vegetarians or meat eaters. \xa0One side is vegetarian, with dishes like veggie samosas, palak paneer, potato and eggplant and dahl, salad and sauces, among other dishes. \xa0The other side has several meat dishes, including chicken, lamb biryani, tandoori chicken and a smaller table with two desserts. \xa0Once seated you're given a choice of regular or garlic naan. All offerings delicious and well seasoned. \xa0My only complaint is service is scattered, it took a while to get water, our naan came out after we had eaten. \xa0Some people got a glass of champagne with lunch and some didn't, including us. \xa0We certainly did not leave hungry and will be back."", 'We enjoyed the buffet at 11:30 AM on a Saturday just as Saffron opened. \xa0They had plenty of vegetarian options as well meat proteins and not extremely spicy, so perfect for me. \xa0They offer sauces and chilies so you can adjust the heat to your liking.The price of $16 includes a nice salad, samosa appetizer, 5 vegetarian choices and 5 protein options including butter chicken, goat and some nice chicken wings with all the fixings. \xa0A highlight was two unusual desserts. \xa0A spread or pudding that tasted like Biscoff or butter cookies and a nice custard mixed with fruit. \xa0The garlic naan was so good. \xa0They initially brought us two pieces each. \xa0I wanted to inhale this but I realized this would offset my ability to try more options. \xa0They offer refills on naan with the buffet and there are 3 choices. \xa0I also liked a green bean dish with cabbage that had a light lemongrass flavor. \xa0They vegetarian stew was also enjoyable.The goat came with a french fried onion strings and had small bones in each piece. \xa0It was seasoned perfectly and nice if you like goat. \xa0The butter chicken and wings were what I have come to expect from a good Indian restaurant.From the start they have a nice salad that is not just lettuce. \xa0They offer 3 sauces for salad and food. \xa0The yogurt based salad dressing was tasty. \xa0I had two servings of the samosas that was accompanied with chickpeas and spices.I thought this was an excellent lunch buffet for the price. \xa0It was a slightly chilly day and we hoped for a hot tea but they offer only iced. \xa0I will be back. \xa0Service was excellent and we were offered more naan, drinks were refilled without asking and a manager checked in to ensure we were satisfied.', ""Stopped in on a Saturday for lunch. They did have a lunch buffet but we ordered off the menu. Started with vegetable samosa which was great. Then we ordered chicken vindaloo, great flavor and nice spice. Andra chicken curry, which also had great flavor and the final entree was (can't remember the name and not online) was a chicken tikka which was marinated with green chilis and cilantro served in a sizzling plate with onion. \xa0That dish was amazing, flavor of the chili and cilantro came thru. Also ordered Garlic naan. Over all the food was very very good. Never had anything bad when I go. One my top 3 for Indian food. The only negative thing was the service. Due to having a lunch buffet they was packed so service was slow. We didn't mind it gave us to chat."", ""Stopped into my favorite Indian restaurant for lunch today and it did not disappoint! First of all, the portion that you receive for lunch, is more of a dinner sized portion! For the vegetarian options, they are $10 and come with naan, the dish of your choice, rice, dhal, a dessert and small samosa. You get BANG for your buck here and the ambience is so nice in there as well as service. It can get a bit loud though as everyone knows how delicious it is and it gets crowded, but you likely will not have a wait though. The naan here is the only naan I get because everywhere else disappoints me. It's fluffy but crispy and buttery and garlicky. So wonderfully perfect! If I lived closer, I would be here at least once a week, absolutely worth it! They also have delicious Woodpecker beer here which compliments the rich food. Come and try it, you will be mad you had not come before!"", ""I was in the mood for a good Indian cuisine, and this was the most recommended Indian restaurant in Orlando. So I had to stop by. It was the middle of the work day, so there were maybe 1 or 2 other people there at the time. I decided to deviate from my normal Chicken Tikka Masala order and get the butter chicken, or Murgh Makhani. It's very similar to the Masala, but just a little more buttery and creamy. It was amazing, and a great alternative if you are trying to get into Indian food. I got the lunch platter, which comes with a samosa as an appetizer and some garlic naan of course. I had this meal with some Moscato and I was in heaven. The meal was so satisfying, no wonder many people from India regard this meal as comfort food. You absolutely must try it. The customer service was wonderful of course. Very attentive and helpful with the menu. The space was very clean. I have no complaints, which is rare. There is a reason why they are the best, they are pros in the kitchen and in the restaurant business.""]",positive

Don't worry that doesn't mean we won't be stopping back to our local Sanford pupusa treasure! However, I do have two minor complaints; The toppings on the pizza could have been spread more evenly and the wings were not tossed thoroughly in BBQ sauce.

"['Yum! The lemongrass tofu was unexpectedly flavorful (better than I\'ve had at other places) and the beef combo pho was excellent as well.

The pokebowl came with a side of either salad or sushi. My friend as an avid sushi fan chose the sushi of course - she later exclaimed how this was her favorite Japanese restaurant in Atlanta by far. Also great were the prices. You get a lot of food for good value, especially comparing to other Japanese restaurants.Overall a great experience and i would definitely visit again soon!', 'Kuroshio opened its third metro Atlanta location in 2017 in the old Steel Restaurant and Sushi Lounge space on the ground level of the Plaza Midtown condominium high-rise at the corner of West Peachtree and Peachtree Place. This is the same building that houses a Publix and other restaurants like Pho King, J. Christopher\'s, Prickly Pear, and Marlow\'s Tavern. Plenty of free parking is available in Plaza Midtown\'s parking garage with entrances on both Peachtree Place and 8th Street.I think this is a fine mid-tier sushi restaurant. It\'s neither a high-end sushi restaurant with an adventurous menu nor is it run-of-the-mill strip mall sushi. It\'s somewhere in between. Unlike Kuroshio\'s locations in Cobb which are known as ""Sushi Bar and Grilles,"" this Midtown location inherits the classed up look and vibe of its predecessor and is referred to as ""Sushi and Lounge."" Along with the trendy ambience, Kuroshio Midtown also brings over almost the same menu that Steel had (yelp.com/biz/steel-resta…) and I believe the owner, Khoa, is the same too. Kuroshio Midtown began operations in May 2017, while the restaurant still had Steel signage, and officially had its grand opening party on July 22nd, 2017.The restaurant is nicely designed and has a casual, relaxed atmosphere. It works for date night and for large groups. There are two bars - one for drinks, the other for sushi - and a variety of seating from standard four-tops to cozy booths and communal high-tops. They have TVs in the bar areas as well as a giant screen projector in a semi-private dining room off to the side. The highlight of the interior is probably the water walls at the front of the restaurant. These appear as numerous strings of water infinitely flowing down. It\'s a neat effect.We visited for dinner where the menu includes appetizers and shared plates like gyoza (potsticker dumplings), tempura, satay (skewers), calamari, and hamachi kama ($6-14 each); salads, soups, and ishikyaki (Japanese hot stone grilled items, $14 each); and entrees including chicken, beef, seafood, fried rice, and noodles ($11-29 each). The sushi menu features about 20 different kinds of nigiri and sashimi including some ""above average"" selections like hirame (flounder), suzuki (striped bass), and ankimo (monkfish liver) ($4-12 for 2 pieces of nigiri, $6-18 for 3 pieces of sashimi). In addition, they offer traditional maki (rolls) and temaki (hand rolls) ($6-11 per order); donburi, chirashi, and poke rice bowls ($16-18 each); sushi assortments ($35-80 per order) and, of course, Americanized ""specialty"" rolls of which there are almost 30 kinds ($12-16 each).Drink-wise, they serve beer, wine, cocktails, Japanese whiskey, and sake (a reasonable selection). On Thursday nights, 5pm-9pm, you can get half-priced bottles of wine and sake.Here\'s what we ordered:* Gekkeikan hot sake ($8)* Edamame ($6) - steamed soy beans sprinkled with sea saltNigiri (2 pieces each):* Madai - Japanese red snapper ($7)* Uni - sea urchin ($7)* Toro - fatty tuna belly ($12)Specialty rolls:* California sunset roll ($14) - fresh salmon and tuna rolled on the inside, topped with avocado and tobiko* Volcano roll ($14) - kanikama and avocado roll topped with a mound of baked assorted fish, blended with spicy aioli and topped with tobiko, masago, and unagi sauceIn general, the food tasted A-OK to good and the dishes had decent presentation.With the Gekkeikan hot sake, you get what you pay for. It\'s cheap sake. Its taste, smell, and finish reminded me of nail polish remover. I like sake, but this is one I do not recommend.We got the edamame for free by checking into the restaurant on the Yelp app and purchasing a specialty roll. Hopefully, the check-in offer will still be valid when you go. Edamame is usually pretty standard at most Japanese/sushi restaurants in terms of taste and quality (not much deviation). However, we were pleasantly surprised by Kuroshio\'s version which was shaken (for salting purposes) tableside and was generously portioned. The edamame were nicely salted and cooked and were delicious.The nigiri was good. Along with the aforementioned hirame, suzuki, and ankimo, the madai, uni, and toro are noted on the menu as being in limited quantity. Fortunately, during our visit, they had the items we wanted. I thought the madai, uni, and toro were all high quality. They weren\'t the best I\'ve had, but they were better than I expected and I\'d order them again. The uni had appetizing texture and flavor (rich) and the toro was buttery and sort of melted in my mouth. I suggest ordering the toro.The rolls were OK. I wasn\'t a huge fan of the sushi rice (in the nigiri too). It didn\'t seem to have enough sugar and vinegar. The sunset roll could have used more flavor and the volcano roll tasted mediocre. At least the fish was fresh.On a moderately busy Friday night, our orders came out quick. Diana R was our server and she did a great job.', ""Watch out for this thieving waitress (HANSEL E) My fiancé and I went out on a date to Kuroshio vday weekend 2-18-19. The food was amazing. But I our sever was horrible. I mean like super horrible. Drinks wasn't refilled. He kept forgetting things we asked him to bring all that type of stuff. But long story short. Hansel decided to give his self a tip off of my fiancé card with our knowledge or consent Now we have been having a hard time reaching management in order resolve this issue. The type of behavior shouldn't be ok. This is technically credit fraud and it's also stealing. But here is a picture of him. So beware my friends. But other than that the shrimp fried rice is amazing. And the sushi is great. Loved the food.  Dear Kuroshio I would love for you guys to reach out and contact me. Thank you"", 'I\'ll admit that I was a little skeptical when we came here for dinner. I figured at most they had rolls and Americanized dishes but what I really craved were nigiri and fresh fish. I was pleasantly surprised by this place and they only reinforced that Atlanta has some of the best Japanese food (especially sushi) around the country. Located in Midtown, you\'ll be hard pressed to find any street parking. You\'d have to make do by finding some garage and most of the time you\'ll have to pay. We came with a few friends and although we came at peak dinner time, we were able to get a table for 5. Service was fantastic and I enjoyed our waitress who was pleasant and efficient. It\'s clear that people come here after work for a good time. People in suits all around us and speaking/laughing loudly. The menu here is extensive so you can get your rolls and specialty items but there is also a pretty long list of sashimi/nigiri. The price was pretty decent already but we came on a Wednesday and between 5-7pm all sushi, sashimi and hot plates are half off. We ordered between 12-15 pieces of nigiri (sorry it was a couple of weeks ago and I can\'t remember precisely!) and with the discount it was great.The nigiri was fantastic. Not as good as, say, Umi or Sushi Hayakawa who I believe are the best sushi places in town, but it\'s up there. The fish was fresh. The rice was perfectly cooked and the right proportion to the amount of fish. Luckily they did have toro although this is dependent frequently on availability.My one beef with this place is that they were slow. It took almost 45 minutes for us to get our dishes. They weren\'t all that full but I don\'t know what the situation is in the back but I really hope that this is not ""a thing"" with them. If it happened to be just that one night, then this is a pretty decent place for great sushi for those who either want something authentic or more modern. And it\'s especially good on Wednesday evenings with the the discount!', ""This is a go-to place for me and my husband for not only great sushi, but an EPIC lunch deal. The ambiance is really nice and every time we've ever gone, it hasn't been overly crowded which is a plus. They have a really great selection of sushi options on the menu that are sure to please any palette, and the prices are super competitive. I also love that their food is always fresh, it's some of the tastiest I've had in the city! The lunch special is where it's at, though. You get a bowl of soup and a ginger salad [or 4 pieces of Nigri], and your choice of sushi roll and I believe it was $15. We were both stuffed at the end, it is a ton of food for the price. We got the Scorpion Roll [my personal favorite] and the Beauty and the Beast and both were fantastic. I personally wasn't a fan of the Unagi on the Beauty and the Beast, but I had never tried it before so it was worth a shot! I also got the Cucumber Margarita and it was really refreshing with just the right amount of cucumber flavor in it. When we came for dinner one night, we got a Saki flight which we loved--it was really nice to be able to have a little taste of all sorts of different saki so that we didn't have to 'commit' to just one flavor. This is a go-to sushi place for us in Midtown!"", 'The last time I came here was when it was Steel many years ago. \xa0Steel had really disappointed me the last time I went for both service and foods. \xa0Therefore, I never bothered to go again. \xa0Now, they have a new owner and the restaurant is now called ""Kuroshio"". \xa0I came back here due to a Prudential Seminar. \xa0We took the back party room (in which I never knew existed). \xa0Ambiance was great. \xa0When the foods came out, we were amazed. \xa0Presentation, proportion, and taste were all so good! \xa0All the foods were flavorable with each bite. \xa0All the servers were also very attentive, fast, and accommodating. \xa0I can\'t wait to go back again.', 'Yet another place I had no idea existed! It was recommended by my date and apparently, previously was named Steel. I\'m so glad I went!! The restaurant\'s holiday decor was en pointe and the quiet, sensual ambience was very welcome- disregard my laughter filling the restaurant and ever so slightly interrupting others\' conversations! Although our server was new, she had a warm personality, was very attentive, and was able to answer our questions or ask someone if she didn\'t know. For palate\'s sake, I elected to try their miso soup with tofu and scallions. It was delicious and not very salty like some other versions I\'ve tried. Salmon Fried Rice was the entree recommended and all I can say is ""Yummy, yummy!"" The portion was plentiful in size and very filling. While I feasted on my dish, he had the Beef, Shrimp Fried Rice and added an extra kick to it by having them prepare it spicy...Lord, he was so happy with his selection.I\'d say we had an excellent time there and I\'m looking forward to the next time we go! Did I mention that parking was super easy?!! This was a huge plus considering it was cold outside!', 'Lots of food for a great price!! This place is awesome and super accommodating. Our waitress was kind enough to give us 3 free orders of edamame although she was unsure if the yelp promotion was 1 per table or 1 per person. Regardless, the promotion itself gives a lot of edamame so I recommend taking one for the table (unless you just love free stuff like me). I went with two friends during lunch and it was not too busy. The ambiance is great; they have this mesmerizing waterfall fountain that I could not stop staring at! and a sushi bar as well. I ordered the salt and pepper chicken bento box and my friends got the spicy shrimp soup and the poke bowl. My friend who is in LOVE with raw fish claims this is her new favorite Japanese restaurant in Atlanta! And why?? Because PORTIONS! The portions here are very generous and come at a great price. In addition, the quality of the food is great as well. I enjoyed my bento box and found the chicken to be seasoned well and very crunchy. I split this meal into two because it was just so much for me to finish. My friend compared the spicy shrimp soup similar to that of a tom yum soup. I definitely recommend this place for college students who want to eat well but not break the bank.', ""I've visited Kuroshio several times now and always had a pleasant experience. FYI The hours have not been updated on Yelp, Kuroshio IS open on Sundays now from 4pm-10pm!Food: *New York Roll ($16): My favorite roll so far. If you really like raw fish (tuna and salmon), I'd recommend the New York Roll. It was super tasty! *Drunken Tiger Roll ($14): It's one of the restaurant's popular rolls. Did not disappoint. Very flavorful. I'd say this is my second favorite. *Big Daddy Roll ($16): Shrimp tempura in the middle with ahi, salmon and yellow tail on top. Very simple roll with some crunchies sprinkled. The roll is very good with spicy mayo. If you like raw fish, this is a good one! yelp.com/biz_photos/kuro…*B52 ($16): This was decent. We're not a wasabi fan and asked for the wasabi mayo to be left out. However, the chef probably forgot because we still tasted the wasabi.  *Firecracker Roll ($12): Comes in 5 relatively large pieces. Has ahi tuna and white tuna in the middle. The outside is crispy fried. It's served with spicy mayo. This roll is a minimalistic one, there's a relatively big cut of tuna--no cream cheese or extra stuffing inside. If you like crunchy rolls, this is it. *Vegetarian Fried Rice ($11): A-OK. There wasn't anything special about this entree. yelp.com/user_local_phot…*Ramen Hot Wok Soup ($14): Eh. Not your typical ramen whether that's packaged ramen or Japanese ramen. The broth is kind of tangy that I was not a fan of. IMO, this is more like a hot and sour soup with shrimp.yelp.com/user_local_phot… Parking: There's a parking garage for all patrons of that building, including Kuroshio. I believe there are a couple entrances, but there's one to the right side of the restaurant. And it's free!

"['My family and I dined in at this restaurant on 3/1/2022. Our experience was less than spectacular. The waitress was not very attentive to our needs. Not really much at all to be honest. Which is fine whatever, she was very busy, we get that but at-least check up on us from time to time. The food was absolutely amazing and did live up to our expectations but the overall experience was terrible. There was an incident with shattered glass at the end of the night and we requested a manager due to the rudeness of one of the staff we asked to cleanup and waited 10 min and was apologized to by our waitress and said he would be right out. Waited another 10 min and left. Not what we expected from this place at all. Food- 5 star Service/Hospitality- 2 star', ""Exquisite and deliciousIt's not often I go and look for seafood but when I do, I make sure it appeals to me. Landry's is a good example of such a place. A bit expensive, but the quality is unbeatable! We started off with some drinks from the bar to celebrate my wife's birthday weekend. I got the Captains punch and she had a margarita. We ordered a crab dip appetizer and that got us going. I convinced.y wife to get the mahi mahi and I decided to try the seafood pasta. Freshness is always important when getting good seafood and my mussels, shrimp and scallops were so tasty, it almost tasted right off the boat. My wife fell in love with her pan seared mahi mahi and was certainly delicious. The atmosphere was romantic and the service was top notch. Certain items from the chefs specialty were unavailable due to it's popularity. Another good sign of the restaurant's reputation. Although the exterior looks over the top with plenty of neon, the interior speaks classy."", ""Coming here during spring break wasn't my first choice, and although we decided to eat relatively early, and we were sat right away, it soon filled with diners. \xa0At the recommendation of our waitress, I selected the cedar plank salmon, a dish I've often prepared at home, and was hopeful it would be cooked just she described, a little crispy around the edges and moist inside with some great cedar flavor. \xa0However, my cedar plank was, well.... Just a platter for my obviously previously cooked salmon. \xa0With no real grill marks under the plank, it was obvious there would be no cedar flavor. Luckily there was an overwhelmingly generous supply of green beans and the rice was perfect. \xa0The accompanying sauce gave the salmon some better flavor. \xa0When restaurants are busy there must be pressure to keep everyone happy. \xa0But taking short cuts isn't very impressive. \xa0Overall, it was ok. \xa0For prices charged and food received, I wouldn't say this was good value. \xa0It's a swing and a miss from me."", ""I came with a large group for a family dinner. The ambience is nice with the this restaurant. The windows were open in some sections and it gave a relaxing vibe, almost like a vacation feel. The service was good, however the food left much to be desired. I had the fried calamari, crab, spinach & artichoke dip, and for my entrée, the grouper topped with crab, mushrooms, and a white wine cream sauce, with veggies and rice for my sides. The calamari was crisp, but remoulade sauce was the only thing helping with the flavor, once it ran out, we didn't want anymore. The same goes for the dip and chips, there was little flavor with the dipping, so adding salt and pepper helped majorly. My grouper was the most bland of my entire meal, fortunately it was fresh so the entire meal was consumed, as the veggies we pretty good after adding some flavor.The vibes are nice of the restaurant along with the service, but the food was average, and I wouldn't return."", 'While down here in Orlando... I went to Landrys seafood restaurant. Been here before years ago and wanted to try it again. I thought it was \xa0a bit pricier than I remembered initially. I got the shrimp po\'boy. It seemed like an open face sandwich. It was ""ok"" but I wouldn\'t get it again. The wait staff was nice and the restaurant was large.

"['Braised Beef Noodle Soup- comfort food anytime!!! Must order! Broth and meat-- the best!', ""We've been several times now, as a date night or introducing small groups of friends and family. There is often a wait but they take reservations and are pretty good about seating you at your assigned time. The food has always been consistent in terms of quality, taste, and hot when it's supposed to be. We did wait a bit for one item we ordered during our last visit, which was a first, but our waitresses was on top of figuring out what went wrong and made sure to address it quickly. We've also gotten items Togo and taken home leftovers and they've still tasted great even after reheating."", ""I have wanted to try this place for a while and finally got to visit with a friend. It was delicious! I do wish I could have had visuals on what I was ordering since in the past I've ordered Dim Sum off a cart, but I it helped to have a basic idea of what I was looking for. The menus are in english so it was easy enough to figure out. The food was delicious, the service was quick and attentive, and I would definitely go back."", ""I really appreciate having someone reach out to me regarding this matter. I didn't put everything that happened in the review, but I still randomly think back on this time & feel extremely low & sad regarding what happened the first time I tried to come here. I honestly never even wanted to come back, but my friends made reservations for their birthday & I anxiously went. I was afraid of coming across Liv again & being belittled but I haven't seen her.I'm really glad I gave this place another chance. The food is just incredible & it takes all of me to not come here every day. I do still get anxious that I'm going to see Liv again & have to relive that awful experience, but I just hope she's gone for good so no one has to go through what I did. I haven't experienced belittlement like that since high school."", ""My husband and I have been wanting to try this place forever. We watched a YouTube video where it was featured and found out there was one not only located in the Portland area but super close, the Washington square mall. We tried numerous times to go but the wait was always insane.Finally the day had come, and it did not disappoint. Mind you, one of my all time favorite foods is dumplings. Once I heard that these dumplings have little balls of broth in them so when you bite into them, it literally melts in your mouth like a savory adult gusher, I was sold.My favorite was by far the Kurobuta pork xiao long bao. Worth every penny. Oh, and you will be spending a pretty one of those here. Next would have to be the Jidori chicken fried noodles - I would hands down get this every time I went. The Jidori chicken wontons with house spicy sauce was good but probz won't get again (also was kinda cold - we made the mistake of ordering everything at once. DONT do this. Take your time here, order as you go. For how busy it was, it was incredibly efficient. So hang out, enjoy the Pear lychee martini, perhaps w/ some friends so you can have numerous options and top off your stomach by packing in as much as you want as you go).I really really liked the pork Hot and sour soup pork and it was relatively cheap (comparatively). But my husband didn't care for it. But I do effing love soup. ESPECIALLY good umami broth. The Pork chop fried rice is some of the best fried rice I have ever had and it totally tastes like they put a whole stick of butter in it, but I'm not complaining. To top off our stomach compartment fully, we got the Chocolate bun. The bun itself isn't my favorite consistency, but I had never tried it before so I had to get them. AND will probz be getting them every time cause it tastes like straight up melted Godiva chocolate in the middle. Melted. Godiva. Nuff' said."", ""Woo hoo! Loved this place. Made reservations because I heard it's crazy crowded with a long wait if you don't. We went for dinner on a weekday, super busy but I think it always is.The food was incredible! We loved every dish we had, especially the xiao Long bao soup dumplings. Also for dessert we had the sesame mochi xiao dumplings and oh my word, they were so tasty. Service was great, food came quickly, so fresh, cocktails were delicious too. Also you can watch them making the dumplings through glass windows outside the restaurant. So cool!"", ""First-time Dine-In Experience | Delicious | Excellent waiter (Charles) We've done take-out a few times since they opened. (Yes, we would drive from Wilsonville to grab dinner) It wasn't as fresh by the time we got home, but it was always delicious. We knew we had to dine in one of these days. My father came to visit us, so we had to take him here. Finally, we made reservations online for 4:15 pm (weekday); we were not disappointed. Charles was our waiter. He is very knowledgeable about the menu and explained to us first-timers how the process works--look at the menu, mark what you want, they come out with your dishes one at a time. So, it's slightly different from the dim sum I've experienced in the past with my family. Charles was very patient with us and always happy to help make sure we were taken care of. Honestly, we would have had a great dinner experience enjoying the tasty food, but it was his service that really made it more complete. (I would've been eating the soup dumplings wrong!)I'm salivating as I write this review...What we ordered:(1) Drinks: Oolong tea, matcha green tea with boba -- holy moly, that matcha is delicious and the boba was soft. (1) Appetizer: Kurobuta pork sticky rice wrap -- we split it three ways (1) Xiao Long Bao: Crab & kurobuta pork XLB (blue and snow crab) -- comes in 10 pieces(1) Dumplings: Jidori chicken dumplings -- comes in 10 pieces(2) Buns: Kurobuta pork buns -- comes in 2 pieces(1) Sauced Noodles: Noodles with minced kurobuta pork sauce -- not spicy(1) Wok Fried Rice: Shrimp fried rice -- light and fluffy, we ordered white rice(1) Wok Fried Noodles / Rice Cakes: Jidori chicken fried noodles -- one of my favorites(2) Desserts: Sesame buns -- MY FAVORITE and highly recommend if you love black sesame! It comes in 2We brought our stomachs and we walked out with two small boxes of leftovers, mainly the rice, noodle dish, and sesame buns. The dumplings and buns are really filling! Every dish was flavorful and not super salty or oily. Thanks to Charles for suggesting the appetizer, the sticky rice wrap was DELICIOUS. One thing I wanted to note was that the chicken in the Jidori chicken fried noodles was so tender! (Most Asian restaurants I've been to tend to overcook the chicken leaving it dry and tasteless.) Another thing I really liked was the amount of filling in the buns. I've been to some dim sum places where the filling is substantially less that you end up eating more bun! Make sure to follow the directions (info card is at the table) on how to eat the soup dumplings! Highly recommend making reservations online. You can always do takeout and still enjoy their food at home.Bottom line: We enjoyed a lovely dinner with excellent service and cannot wait to come back here again."", ""I've visited the Bellevue location before, and was pleased with their dishes. However, this Tigard location was just ok.The truffle XLB had the flavors of truffle and small pieces in the filling, but it was just alright. The crab XLB and shrimp fried rice were just ok as well. The dumplings are indeed very skillfully made (many folds), but a couple of our dumplings had leaked out their soup when they arrived to our table. DTF does provide ~special~ ingredients such as truffle and Kurobuta pork, but I've had more flavorful XLB elsewhere.However, the chocolate mochi dumplings were very good and unique!

"['I haven\'t been to Titaya\'s for many years, since before their remodel, but I was so glad I stopped in. Although I knew of it\'s location I almost drove right past it, since they don\'t have a large sign (just an understated one on the building itself), and aren\'t listed on the shopping center\'s sign. But no worries--I obviously found it!I walked in to a beautifully-appointed restaurant and asked for a booth. No problem. There were plenty of other patrons with smiling faces, an extremely friendly and helpful server who appeared exactly when needed, and a menu with all of the usual Thai offerings plus several that are special to Titaya\'s. I wanted to branch out and try something new and different, but my taste buds were set before I walked in! I will try other things on another day. I ordered the small Tom Yum soup (S1), which wasn\'t a small cup by any means, but a true bowl. It was very flavorful and had all of the inedibles (like stalks of lemongrass) strained out, which was nice. It had just the right balance of individual ingredients to broth as well. Tom Yum Yummy! \xa0I took most of it home for later. Next was the Pad Kee Mao (N5) with chicken. I had asked for very firm noodles--I\'m definitely an al dente gal-- and they came out sorta firm, but at least not mushy, thank goodness. This was my only disappointment of the meal since I would have liked much firmer noodles, but it wasn\'t egregious enough to send back to the kitchen. \xa0The delicate flavors were in harmony so no soy or fish sauce needed to be added. That, in my book, is the sign of good Asian cooking--not having to ""fix"" the dish with added sauces of your own. It was a spicy dish (as was the soup), but it was an enjoyable spicy and not overdone. \xa0Plus, before my order was placed, the server asked me if that spice level was okay for me. \xa0Her attentive service is appreciated. Lastly, I thought the prices were darn good, considering the quality and quantity received. It was definitely money well-spent, especially since it was basically two meals for me. I\'m looking forward to visiting Titaya\'s again, and if you are a Thai food fan who hasn\'t tried them yet, DO!', ""3.5 star rather This place is crowded and you will have 15-20 mins wait time to get in ! The staff here is nice. The menu has lots of options. The food here is good especially the appetizers. The curries I found were bit salty so won't order again. Loved the pineapple Thai fried rice which were good. The spinach dumpling were not that great the outer layer was thick and chewy. Pad Thai here is a pre made store version kind of tasting but tastes good! Decent ambience ! Worth trying."", ""So delicious and affordable!! \xa0My favorite Thai restaurant I've been to in Austin & one of my favorite chilly-weather spots in town. \xa0And, it's convenient because there's an actual parking lot as opposed to trying to park downtown. \xa0Must try the Tom-Yum & Tom-Kha soups!!

Chuu Chee Pla: \xa0This is one of Titaya\'s Classic favorites and a must for those who love fish as the Basa fish was still crispy when we got home and a decent sized filet. \xa0Mom\'s coconut red curry sauce that was packaged on the side was also super flavorful and delicious but definitely had a kick, so get that rice ready if you aren\'t a fan of the heat!-Pad Kee Mao: \xa0Yummy flat rice noodle stir-fried with some yellow onions, mushrooms, fresh basils, tomatoes, bell peppers and fresh Thai chili. \xa0Just as a heads up if you order this dish as they serve it, it is quite spicy...Overall, if you are looking for some solid Thai food definitely check this place out! \xa0Oh and as a heads up, this place doesn\'t mess around with their spice level so if you and spice don\'t get along, definitely ask to modify or look for the dishes that don\'t have the chili icon next to it. \xa0On the flip side, if you love spice, be sure to ask to bump up the spice level, but it will cost an additional $0.50 per increase in spice level.', ""Haven't been to Titaya's in years. But we were in the area and I talked Charlie into Thai for lunch. It's so hard to decide what to get because of so many fresh choices, but he got tofu fried rice and I got yum 4 with ground pork and shrimp, both medium hot. Both were absolutely perfectly flavorful and had heat without being impossible to eat. $25 lunch (plus tip) made 3 almost 4 meals.

When this place popped up on Yelp with stellar reviews I was excited since I feel like Austin doesn't have too many authentic Asian restaurants. My friends and I got a variety of items and we taste tested a little bit of everything. To start with we got their Sweet Corn Taro Fritters which was a very unique appetizer. They had a crispy and sweet taste to them, so if you are looking to try something new this would be it. I ended up ordering the pad kee mow, but to be honest it was sooooo spicy that it wasn't enjoyable. My friends also ordered the pad thai which was delicious and a chicken curry noodle soup. I personally got the papaya salad which had a very good kick to it. For reference the pad kee mow was more spicy than the papaya salad. Overall I would come back to this place, but I would just be weary on their spicy levels."", 'Pretty good, but could be better!Picked up some to-go food cause I was craving Thai style noodle soup and I got their duck noodle soup. The flavor was great, the soup is super aromatic, almost a medicinal herbal smell and came with a giant duck thigh. The egg noodles and soup were much saltier than I would like, and I wish it came with a bit more veggies, but otherwise the flavor and portion was great! I only waited about 15 mins and the food was packed really well. I also tried their black rice pudding and it was super rich and yummy, just the right amount of sweet. Definitely worth a try! I really want to try their pad thai next time.', ""TLDR: Great place for some good Thai Food. \xa0Came here for dinner. I got in relatively early, so the place really wasn't busy at all. All I got was an order of Pad Thai. The service was great, everyone was really nice. My food took ~10 minutes to make, so my wait wasn't bad at all. overall, the dish was really good. I don't really have any major complaints with anything I got. I would definitely recommend this to a friend, and will probably be back soon. 4/5""]",positive
"['This was my first time back to \'Ohana\'s since the shutdown. Food is no longer on skewers, it\'s now served family style. The steak and a few others did taste a little different, but they are still phenomenal, and some of the best food I have eaten. \xa0If you want to watch the Magic Kingdom fireworks during dinner, this is a great place to do so as most of the dining room over looks the Seven Seas Lagoon. \xa0We did have the fire alarm go off during our dinner, and had to evacuate, the cast members did a great job of keeping us safe as we waited for an ""all-clear."" \xa0\'Ohana\'s is still one of my favorite restaurants on Disney Property, it is absolutely worth every penny.', ""'Ohana is a WDW must! My family and I have been going here for (possibly) the last decade. I can't remember when my first experience was but it hasn't changed much from what I had last night. So first things first... I didn't have a reservation. I know. Shame on me for not booking a reservation 60 days in advance. However, I was able to squeeze in my family of 8 for dinner near 6ish PM, which was probably the highlight of my trip back to WDW.Oh well. Onto the food! The meal consisted of unlimited bread & butter, mixed greens salad with the heavenly citrus vinaigrette, honey-coriander chicken wingies, noodles, teriyaki beef, shrimps, grilled chicken with chimichurri sauce, dumplings, and thee best bread pudding on the planet. So why the four stars? Well, the service was indeed amazing with Disney magic but some of our food did come out cold. However, I'm not one to send back food or waste so we ate as much as we can. I mean the portions are tremendous, which is a double-edged sword because you won't go hungry but watching the food be tossed away is sadness itself. But I digress... 'Ohana means family. And my family & I love to feast at 'Ohana."", ""Once the greatest, now just a shadow of once was. \xa0There was a point in Disney World history that this was the best they had to offer. \xa0It's not anymore. \xa0The price has climbed and climbed and the food quality and service has declined significantly. \xa0The wait staff here is smart, especially if they have a group of 5 or larger when the gratuity is built in automatically. \xa0The second the payment is made and they return to the table with the check, you are likely to not see them again. \xa0They have moved on to making tips at the next customer. \xa0The food has not improved, the shrimp are not shelled, or de legged, so eating 3 or 4 of them is really a difficult maneuver, and especially displeasing to kids. \xa0The steak is good, the chicken has changed for the worse. \xa0And the dumplings and sauce that once ruled on high have fallen. That black savory sauce that used to come with the dumplings has been replaced with peanut sauce. \xa0Not good. \xa0The steak is good, but the noodles tasted very much like they sat under a heat lamp for far to long. \xa0The point here is, the food quality is a marginal step up from Golden Corral. \xa0All in all, if you have four kids like me, you'll realize quick that you spent two hundred and forty dollars (sixty/kid after forced gratuity) on a bowl of Mac and cheese and 5 chicken fingers. \xa0Here's a few tips you probably don't know1. You get free refills on all meat, bread and any other item they bring2. Order any non alcoholic drinks you like. \xa0There's no extra charge, soda for dinner, coffee for desert, teas add red desert3. \xa0They don't Advertise this but for kids, as well as the regular food which they won't eat, they can bring out Mac and Cheese and Chicken tenders but only if you ask, it's not brought out by default4. \xa0Desert is also free refills, ask for more ice cream, or bread pudding. Then when your kids complain because bread pudding is hated by most kids ask for more ice cream and rice crispy treats. \xa0All included in the price. \xa05. \xa0You can order the meat the way you like it cooked. \xa0Order more steak but medium rare, do it. \xa0You are paying the literal price for half a cow. \xa0Don't be shy. \xa0I'm frustrated that my favorite place on earth has been reduced to an overpriced quick serve restaurant with mandatory gratuity for my family of 6 and price increased to an obnoxious amount."", ""'Ohana is a great place to go for families of all sizes! Some may complain about the price but it is all you can eat! And the wait staff is amazing as most Disney restaurants are! The breakfast is pretty simple and straight forward but still enjoyable and I love going when I can!The dinner is also enjoyable and as I stated while some may consider it expensive, it's worth it! It's such a variety of food and you can ask for more of whatever you like! Even just eating the salad, one appetizer, and steak can justify the price but when you get shrimp, chicken, potstickers, noodles, wings, salad, bread, steak, it's just a great place to go!"", 'This is a Disney resort restaurant here. The Atmosphere is excellent. It is very hard to get a reservation. The stand by service was good. We just have to eat a little late . We signed up and sat right down within 5 min. The shrimp was excellent . The steak is cooked well done . No cooked to order . The chicken wings were on point . The lo mein was excellent . The house salad was amazing . The honey butter bread and butter is still die for . Service was quick and pain less. Everyone took good care of us . Price point is $55 a head . Pretty cheap. I always eat here when I come to Disney 4 points . The over cooked steak was cooked lost a point', 'This place survives on the goodwill of nostalgia and location, because it is definitly not what it used to be.I have eaten at this location multiple times in the past so had high expectations for the experience and the food. \xa0Both fell far short. \xa0Even tempering them for the current Covid and labor environment, sans the fireworks, nothing about the experience warranted the price tag.First, the directions on the check in directions are vague about where to go. \xa0Once we figured it out, we still weren\'t sure because rather than a welcoming podium to check in, it feels more like a server side station. \xa0We checked in with what could best be described as a functional check in. \xa0It got the job done, but there was nothing ""magical"" to it. \xa0The young lady asked if it was our first time and we indicated I was the only one who had previously visited. \xa0The previous seating experience where they would point out the bread, discuss the firepit and really make you feel like family was markedly absent. \xa0Once we were seated our server,introduced himself. \xa0He was pleasant and had a friendly demeanor but I would not consider him attentive. \xa0My roommate, who is studying Hawaiin spoke a word or two to him and he was very kind in the interaction, but he always felt rushed or if he had other things to do.When we were served our bread, I was VERY disappointed to receive Hawaiian rolls like I could buy in any store. \xa0The bread at the Polynesian is something I\'ve talked up to my friends for some time. \xa0 When I asked our server about it, he just said they didn\'t have it anymore, as he was already walking off. \xa0He similarly did so throughout our meal. \xa0It just felt like he was rushed and wasn\'t paying proper attention, especially true when we requested more bread and it came to us stacked in a bowl that was too small for it and it took about 10 minutes for him to come around long enough to ask for more butter to go with it. \xa0I\'m generally very forgiving of servers, but for the price this place charges and the fact that almost every table\'s meal is identical, then the service should be 100% spot on.The first skillet with noodles was just OK. \xa0We were a little disappointed that it only came out with two pieces of undercooked broccolini for a table of 4 and the temperature of everything was lukewarm as if it had been sitting. \xa0The teriyaki noodles bland and the dry, sauceless dumplings forgettable.When the proteins arrived it felt like a chuck wagon experience. \xa0I understand serving this way due to covid, however for the price and the fact it\'s Disney we expected at least some style of themed presentation, but what we got was cast iron skillets dropped on the table. \xa0The chicken and steak were OK but nothing special. \xa0They were slathered in sauce that did not fit the theme from a flavor standpoint and visually looked like I would expect from a buffet on I-Drive. \xa0Nothing tasted as if it had been marinated, something I clearly remember at least one or two of them to be, and the shrimp was pretty much all pepper. \xa0The meats ranged in temperature from hot off the grill to warm-ish. \xa0We did have to request multiple servings of most items but that\'s because we didn\'t receive\xa0enough for four people of a few of the items.The highlight of the meal was the dessert.\xa0 The pineapple bread pudding was phenomenal, so much so we had to have more and devoured it.\xa0 It would have been really nice to have had coffee with it.\xa0 I even asked if they\xa0had Kona Coffee available and was told it was available next door.\xa0 There was no offer or indication of any kind of coffee being available and he walked away before I could ask.The atmosphere overall was disappointing.\xa0 The spirit of Hawaii and the magic of Disney just weren\'t there.\xa0 When the fireworks took place, we could only hear about half of the soundtrack, and we were seated right underneath a speaker.\xa0 The lights in the restaurant\xa0remained completely up muting the experience.\xa0 It would have been nice for them to be dimmed even slightly.\xa0 When the ukelele player roamed, he didnt sing and we never saw him interact with anyone, he just strolled and played.When I made the reservation I indicated we had a special celebration that evening and a birthday, and neither was ever acknowledged, and the birthday girl never left the table at a time that created an opportunity to bring it up.When we left, I asked how to reach out to provide feedback on the disappointing experience and was told I HAD to do it then, so even though I didn\'t want to seperate from my party did. \xa0The manager I spoke to was very nice and listened, but basically offered a sorry. \xa0I expect more from any resturaunt where I\'m paying almost $100 for dinner and one drink, but especially from Disney. \xa0There are much better options in this price range on Disney property, and certainly options for much less, with better food just off property in the surrounding area.', ""First and foremost the service was impeccable. I would give a shout-out to my server if I could remember her name. Maybe I can find it in the receipt.  Although it's not a buffet, it is served family style and all you care to enjoy. This meal is a foodie adventure all by itself. Keep in mind they are serving a lot of people as quick as they can, so everything that comes out is not always hot or made to order. \xa0Bread/SaladThe salad was pretty much salad. The citrus dressing was good, but strong. I'd advise adding it in moderation. The bread was baked with pieces of mango inside of it. It was firm on the outside, soft in the middle, and served at room temperature. It was tasty enough that I wanted to have another piece, but I decided to save room for the main course. If the main course sucked, then I could eat more bread. *Spoiler, it did not suck!!* Main CourseThe sticky honey teriyaki wings had plenty of flavor. In fact, they are so sticky, they bring you a warm towel to wipe your hands with. The pork pot stickers had a a slight crispness on the edges and the filling was fantastic. The famous Ohana noodles that everyone craves so much were well flavored, but a little over cooked for my taste. They were hitting the borderline mushy phase. The steak loins were cooked medium rare. The first piece I had was a little on the rubbery side so it was disappointing. As I cut into a different piece of steak I could tell it was way more tender. The second piece of steak was much much better. A little redemption on their part. \xa0The shrimp were well seasoned and flavorful. The chimichurri chicken thighs were incredible. They exceeded my expectations. DessertThe pineapple and coconut bread pudding was topped with ice cream with a side of warm caramel. This is by far the best dessert I've had on Disney property. You really need to try it if you get the opportunity. TIP: You can save money by ordering the bread pudding dessert by itself from the bar at the Tambu Lounge. Plus reservations at Ohana have been hard to come by. PricingIt's $55 per person for the meal plus drinks. There were 2 of us. Even though it's all you care to eat, we didn't make it past the first round. I wold say $35-$40 is a more appropriate price. As far as table service on Disney Property goes, it is by far in the top 3 meals we have had. It's a bit pricey, but was well worth the experience."", ""For an all you care to eat restaurant at Disney this is the place! The food is flavorful and definitely filling. This was my husband's first time here and it was great! We were seated with a window view right in front of Magic Kingdom and Cinderella's castle.The soft drinks are included in the steep price ($55pp) and they brought out the bread and salad right away. We loved the main course though. The garlic noodles are my favorite and the chimichurri chicken. My husband loved the pork dumplings and steak the most. We only ordered one round but this is a great place for those who are hungry and worked up a good appetite. The pineapple bread pudding was a great treat at the end, I mean there is always room for dessert no matter how full you are."", ""I've been coming to ohana since I was a kid, absolutely loved this restaurant. It's budget friendly and you get a lot of food. Highly recommend for anyone wanting to book here."", 'I was very lucky to refresh the dining options on the Disney app a million times while my brother was visiting and landed a reservation here, and let me tell you oh boy was I a lucky one! Due to new restrictions are parking, we were not able to park at the resort, but I am an annual pass so we parked at Magic Kingdom. We took the monorail to the Polynesian Village, which did not take long and was not a hassle. When we got in the resort we arrived a little early, so we enjoyed walking around and looking at the resort. There is a little cafe where you can get some coffee and some gift shops to look around. Once we checked in we were sat in under 5 minutes. Everything is served family style, but since I eat plant based we both got our own skillets. I appreciate that they still gave us a good helping of food. For $25 per person, you receive A LOT of food. When you first get seated they come over with a stitch juice, which I am pretty sure is passion fruit and orange, which was very good! For the normal order you receive a Pineapple-Coconut Breakfast Bread, my brother RAVED about the bread, he even debated ordering more. Typically for plant based you receive a doughnut, but I never received one, which I thought was fine because I snacked on almost all the fruit! For both skillets you receive eggs, sausage, potatoes, and waffles. The other difference is the normal skillet gets ham and biscuits. The plant based skillet was delicious, the plant based eggs were cooked to perfection and everything was seasoned amazingly. For the other, my brother had not stopped raving the whole meal, he even made little sandwiches with the biscuits. Overall, if you can get a reservation I highly recommend!']",positive

That said, I did quite enjoy the brisket hash, brisket was very flavorful and tender, but also quite pricey."", 'We were here on Tuesday night to celebrate our anniversary. Overall, it was a nice experience, but the only thing that really wow-ed us was the decor. One of us had been to the back bar area for drinks before, but we were in the main dining room this time around and the atmosphere is lovely. We didn\'t enjoy the massive circular booth that we were in but whatever. It was definitely quiet around 6:00 pm when we arrived, so we were happy to be leaving once it got busy. Started with drinks, and Eberly is keeping the trend going of idiotic names for them. The mezcal in the ""Don\'t Look Back"" completely overpowered the rest of the drink, including the apricot puree which had sounded like a promising addition. The ""Nick the Lounge Singer"" (eye roll emoji here) and ""lonesome traveler"" were fine.For food, we got the beet salad and the grilled octopus as starters. For the salad, the beets were cooked (what the hell was ""pickled""?, um no) and ain\'t no way that was labne unless it came out of a plastic jar. It wasn\'t bad, per se, but it\'s annoying when dishes don\'t come out as advertised. Re. the octopus: it was sliced up, like into PIECES. What the actual F? Are you KIDDING? Why on god\'s green earth would you serve the octopus in slices unless you 1) precooked it and then are just heating it up or 2) are really trying to get away with such a measly amount. That dish was so creative and delicious (seriously), but the presentation just ruined it. For mains, the pasta ragu was light on the meat but tasted good; the short rib hit the spot--perfectly cooked and the flavors popped.Dessert was nothing impressive: couple random ice cream flavors and a mediocre frangipane tart. Service was kinda fine. It took the guy a long time to come over initially (even though the place was dead) and he forgot to put in the house salad that we also ordered. But after that, he managed to get the job done.Bottom line: good, not great, though we\'d be willing to go again. 3.5 stars: one of us thinks it should be rounded down, but the other thinks it should be rounded up and he\'s going to win this time. 4 stars, but you can and should do better, Eberly.', ""In short: definitely don't go to this place for special occasion, below average food and sucky service for higher price!!We made a reservation for our anniversary brunch almost two weeks before, and mentioned in our reservation under special occasion, so when we checked in, saw there garden covered patio was not full, and asked if we can get a table there, and the girl who was checking in told, they have a reservation for that place at 12:45, we were there @ 11:30 and I asked we too made a reservation and there's no where you can pick a place while making reservation, then she thought for a minute and told, you can add it as a requestSo you pick them for a special occasion and specify it in the reservations and request something, which they could've done, but they say no and give you a lame excuse??Our host was okay, dint even bother to check even once if everything was okay.Food is okay nothing special, we ordered milk rolls, hot chicken sandwich, French toast, El Paso( cocktail )Milk rolls: it looked glossy, but it's just like Hawaiian rolls, warm on top and cold at the bottom, they haven't even warmed up thoroughly.Cocktail was just okay French toast: this was good, but single slice French toast \xa0 For$$$Hot chicken sandwich: there was nothing hot in it, it's just dry hard chicken breast in between the bun, we dint taste any white cheddar or burnt onion aioli as they have described it.So overall I don't recommend this place, and especially not for special occasion!!"", ""Cool decor inside and good food, albeit priced higher than it should be for the level of service received. I can't knock anything for slow service given most places are short staffed, but it just felt like they weren't really present for a place with a nearly $100 aged ribeye.That said, I would come back again just for the cocktails and dessert, including the sticky toffee pudding and the Dont look back Mezcal drink. The harissa chicken tasted great and was very juicy but only came with a couple pieces of asparagus and not enough vegetable."", ""This is possibly the best cauliflower I've ever eaten. There was so much flavor and the perfect amount of cauliflower. There are some places I've gone to where they have some sort of expensive cauliflower dish and it'll only have 5 pieces of bland cauliflower. It kind of feels like you're getting robbed.

The crispy potatoes can be skipped. They aren't that great.The other items we ordered received good feedback overall though, so I would still recommend Eberly.

"[""We had reservations here for dinner but ended up here while following the Freedom Trail and tried it out for lunch instead. This place is huge! We did not think it was going to open into a big restaurant with lots of seating. We ordered a bowl of clam chowder, mussels and the two crab cake appetizers. Our waitress was attentive, friendly and very helpful when picking our appetizers. Clam chowder- the best. The chunks of clam were large, potatoes perfectly cooked and the seasonings within the soup pulled everything together. Mussels- delicious sauce they used for the mussels, large amount and all very hot when we ate them.Crab cakes- I should learn to never order crab cakes from anywhere but Maryland but we figured Boston does other seafood right so we'd try. I don't recommend. It tastes like there's cheese within the mix and it doesn't work well with the normal taste of a Maryland crab cake. The only bad thing we had!"", ""Union Oyster House was my least favorite dining spot during a trip to Boston. They bring you corn bread to start. It was good, a tiny bit dry but flavor was there. I started off with the French Onion Soup - the broth flavor was very good but there was limited bread and cheese making it mostly liquid. I don't eat seafood so I peeled red the Union Chicken Club. It was incredibly basic for a sandwich with only grilled chicken, lettuce and tomato (pickle was gross) but at a price of $18. It wasn't worth the money. As far as the seafood goes, my boyfriend ordered the clam chowder. He was really disappointed with the amount of clams in the soup and the cup was very small. For his dinner, he ordered the Lobster Mac and hardly ate it. It wasn't cheesy/creamy at all so it was very bland. The only thing he did enjoy was the Stuffed Clams which you get 3 total. Service was good, our waitress had a great personality."", ""My sister and I were going to a concert so we decided to find somewhere close to the venue to eat better we went to the show. We decided on Union oyster house. The waitress was kind of rude I don't know if she was tired or what she was pulling menus out of our hands before we were ready to give them to her she was ok sometimes and sometimes she wasn't. I had a watermelon martini it was horrible. It was full of some cheap alcohol and that looked like food coloring. My sister didn't complain about her old fashioned so I assumed she liked it. The cornbread they bring when you sit down is pretty good I'm nota big fan of cornbread but it was alright. The stuffed oyster appetizer was good too I love squeezing lemon on it. It was pretty tasty. My sister loved her clam chowder ( it wasn't better than legals) I sent y martini back and ordered a red rum fizz. It was basically a dirty Shirley but still nasty. Not good at all. I ordered clam with bellies I wanted onion rings with. They have onion rings but won't let you order them with anything except the seafood platter \xa0so I had to eat basic French fries. My sister ordered haddock n shrimp with FF. They both were fried very well I feel like they should've given more seafood n FF. We got the bill it was $130. I was surprised I was expecting the bill to be about $80. Between the service and the price I won't be visiting this place again. I also had to circle the block about 5 times before I found a parking space. It just wasn't worth it"", ""A friend that use to go to college here told me about this place and said we must have dinner here. It is the oldest restaurant in America, it's been here since 1826 and is a national landmark. We didn't have reservations on that night and had to wait about 30 minutes to get seated. We got sat upstairs in a cool old-school booth. Our waiter was quick on his feet and the food came out nice and tasty! I've never had huge size raw clams before until here! They were one of the freshest and biggest I have had. Skip the oysters and get the raw clams, you won't be disappointed. Ordered a crab cake and also some baked beans just because it was somewhat their specialty. Found out I'm not a fan of baked beans, to me, they taste too sweet. But I'm not a bean person. Overall if you are in Boston might as well go to the oldest restaurant in America am I right?"", 'Union Oyster has a very neat space and was told that it was a staple in Boston. It had a great atmosphere to it and looks like it has a lot of history to it. The meals came with cornbread that was actually pretty good. I had the sea scallops and shrimp with was in a creamy tomato sauce over rice. The food was cooked very well and tasted good. It was not anything crazy delicious, but it was pretty good. Next time I want to try the clam chowder. I also had the calamari which was cooked perfectly and had a great marinara sauce with it.', ""One of the oldest restaurants in Boston! We got fresh oyster, steam lobsters, and clam chowder. Their corn bread was really delicious.

Didn't close as early as it's competition. \xa0Attentive wait staff. The food Came out pretty quicky. Had the lobster and it was quite delicious. Would be back!!! \xa0 Grade: A"", ""The BF planned a day for us before the game and this was top on the list. If you're in this city, you must stop. Sit at the bar, have a dozen oysters and experience living history."", ""Funny story. This was the first restaurant we ate at in Boston. The place is like a bit of history. The inside was really cool and had some really interesting artwork.The food was ok. The clam chowder was tasty, but not amazing. The cornbread was a little dry but tasty. We had some raw oysters and they were pretty good. I also got the oyster po-boy and that was good, but could have used a a good remoulade.The scallops were pretty good and came with shrimp and rice. We were on the fence about it.After we ate we took a self guided freedom trail tour and ended up going past the Union Oyster House on the tour, only to find out that it's the oldest restaurant in the country. Pretty cool if you ask me."", ""This restaurant popped up a lot on searches for where to eat in Boston and is historic so we thought it'd be nice to check out. It's along the freedom trail, so if you're following that, you'll likely pass it and the other restaurants and bars on this street. We had a reservation for 7:30pm on a Friday night, but it wasn't super packed or anything so you might be able to walk-in on a non-holiday weekend.Overall, it was okay and more fun for the history than the quality of food. The clam chowder lacked depth of flavor and tasted mostly like cream and potatoes. Their raw bar oysters were very fresh though and I would recommend getting those. Mild and clean in flavor. We also got a caesar salad that was pretty standard. No complaints but no wows either. There's also complimentary cornbread at the beginning, but it was really dry. Our waitress was really nice though! She came to check on us frequently and had lots of recommendations. The ambience \xa0-- the restaurant definitely shows its age. Darkly lit, feels a bit grimy. There's a lobster tank upfront. The booths are really tight and the backs of the booths are not upholstered so you will be leaning against a flat wooden wall which I found to be uncomfortable. The booths do have some historical art on the wall which you can read if you find that to be interesting. I would say...if you're cramped for time, skip this, or just hop in for a quick drink and oysters. Appreciated the history, wasn't a huge fan of the food (and Boston has a lot of history sprinkled throughout to see, so it's not like this has to be THE THING you do here).""]",negative
"['I actually did not have this on my radar while visiting Austin recently but one of my traveling companions did and I am so glad we made it a point to dine here for brunchThey have a reserve ahead option which I highly recommend as they were slammed when we arrived. We only had to wait about 10 minutes (thanks to prior on line reservations) and were promptly seated. Kitschy vibes and food await. They fit a LOT of people in that space so be warmed. Menus are they WR code so it might be a good idea to review it while you are waiting. Lots of classic and Tex max options with a variety of modifications based on dietary needsI got the tacos and subbed tofu and split some banana bread French toast (on special but get it if available). Tacos hit the spot. The hubs got a Benny which had a perfect egg on it We also got some mimosas to round out the meal. Mini leftovers remained. A sign of a good breakfast Breakfast TacosBreakfast TacosEggs Benedict', ""Absolutely wonderful experience! We came today around 0715 and were waited on by a younger gentleman with buzzed/shaved sides. (My husband and I wish we could remember his name). He was such an absolute joy. Interacted with my nephew so happily and lively that my nephew felt comfortable enough to place his order directly to him. I picked this establishment due to their plant based options and when I ordered the tofu scramble I was actually told they were out of tofu. The gentleman was so cordial and apologetic and offered me an alternative so delicious sounding that I couldn't say no. Thank you for that! I'm leaving our happy picture to hopefully remind the waiter(if he sees this) that if we ever return to Austin, he'll be the main reason we'll choose to eat here again!"", ""A very worthy spot if you're looking for breakfast or brunch in the area. I ordered take-out and I'm assuming the food tasted just as good as dining in, as long as you pick your food up on time and don't let it sit out too long. My gf ordered the Spuds Deluxe ($12.75), where you get to choose two toppings with additional toppings costing extra. She chose Avocado, Sausage, and Mushroom (+$0.75). Mix all of those toppings with a heap of hash browns and cheese, you got yourself a winner. I ordered the Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes ($9), which was a pretty unique pancake topping I have came across. Apparently it's a popular item and I can see why. Tastes great and it's super filling."", 'This place has lots of variety. I love eggs Benedict for brunch and luckily this place lets you get a duo and try out to different eggs Benedict combos.

The line moves quickly but not that quickly so it's definitely a good idea. It's a cute little restaurant that's super busy and while I would've loved a teensy bit more attention from our server I definitely would come back here. The signature flight was actually better than I thought it would be, the sweet potato pancakes were my favorite followed by the Blueberry then the pineapple. The bennys were definitely interesting but I think I prefer to keep mine on a biscuit or English muffin. I was surprised that I preferred the Chile Verde to the lox because I love smoked salmon but I think it was the hash brown base for that one that really held it back. The last thing I think it's worth noting is that they provide Sir Kensington ketchup instead of the classic heinz and it's definitely a more tomato-y ketchup so don't down your potatoes in it before tasting it. Oh and the pay via QR code thing makes splitting the bill super easy but looking at the menu on my phone got to be annoying so I was able to ask for a physical menu and that was much easier."", ""My first time at snooze this weekend and it was overall ok.

"[""I've been dying to try Futago after seeing it on so many of my friends' IG stories, so it was very exciting when I had the chance to come by for dinner on a Sunday - my friend and I arrived around 6:30 or so, and it was around a 20 minute wait before we were seated. (There are a decent amount of tables inside, and turnover is relatively quick and efficient.)We ordered the chicken tatsuta-age to start, which was fantastic; the marination adds that extra level of flavour to the juicy chicken that lets it stand out from the more common karaage chicken at other restaurants. Not too much in terms of quantity, but perfect for 2 to share.For our main dishes I ordered the cheese niku curry udon, and my friend had the kamo nanban udon (udon with slices of marinated duck). I was blown away by how delicious it was - I'm usually not a fan of curry flavoured broths, but this soup was amazing. The perfectly-cooked noodles to just the right degree of hardness, the savoury slices of beef and the touch of gooey cheese that ties it all together (even literally...) Portion sizes are also perfect - enough to be full but not uncomfortably so, and with enough space for dessert afterwards :) Their menu is actually quite expansive, and I am getting hungry right now just thinking about what I should order on my next visit - I can't wait!"", ""We came here for an early dinner on Friday, was seated promptly. After 6pm on weekends, there definitely will be a wait. Although the prices of the udon is on the higher side, it did taste very good. The sukiyaki is our favorite-- lots of fatty meat and delicious udon broth. The udon was cooked a bit to a bit softer than we'd like but nothing to complain about."", 'Next to the BU dorms is this gem! A lot of students eat here and the vibe is definitely casual. I got the agedashi tofu and kami nanban udon. Agedashi tofu: the perfect fried yet chew consistency. I love it when the tofu gets soaked into the broth, making the skin have a clear membrane. I thought the mushrooms were a fun addition.Kami nanban udon: simple noodles with duck dish. A simple delight to warm you up during the colder months. Overall: I thought place was extremely delightful for a quick lunch.', ""I visited Boston (from the Bay Area) so I wasn't expecting really exciting Asian food. Futago udon meets the expectation! Clean interior and really yummy udon with lots of variety.I got the duck udon but the duck was a little tough for my taste and the broth was a little too flat (it was a dashi broth). My friend's truffle beef udon, on the other hand, was amazing. The truffle really infuses throughout the broth. I should have gotten this! The serving sizes are also generous. One of my favorite meals while I was visiting Boston."", ""The food here is very tasty!! Got the curry chicken udon and it was good! The udon both looked good and tasted good. The crispy chicken also was very ~crisp~ and not soggy. There was a nice spicy furifake type seasoning to add to the udon afterwards which really flavored the dish well. I did wish there was more udon after I finished, but maybe that's just me still craving it after I finished."", ""My mom and I came on a Sunday right at opening (12pm). To my surprise, there were a good amount of people already waiting. The restaurant is pretty small, and they made it very clear that you had to keep your mask on unless you were eating. I'm glad that they're taking things so seriously here.We ordered the sukiyaki udon, curry fried chicken, and takoyaki. The takoyaki was light and crispy on the outside, and very flavorful on the inside. I was surprised to get actual chunks of octopus tentacles where I could clearly see and feel the suction cups. I've definitely never experienced that at other places I've gotten takoyaki at - not sure how I feel about it, but the dish was still delicious. The curry fried chicken was my absolute favorite! The chicken was fried so nicely without being too oily. The curry was so yummy - this dish was amazing! The sukiyaki udon was definitely milder than the curry fried chicken udon. The broth was a bit sweet, but still tasted good! I loved the chunks of mushroom!Overall, we had a great experience! I'll definitely be back for the curry fried chicken!!"", ""I saw this restaurant pop up on my feed and had to try it! Parking was a little difficult since it's mostly residential parking, but if you walk 2 blocks over, there are plenty of meter parking on Beacon StreetWe were stopped at the front and asked to keep our masks on until our food came out. The interior style was minimal and open, we were served immediately. We got the fried baby octopus (was craving it since Itokku had it as a special). Their udon was great- I was a little nervous regarding the creamy uni udon, but it isn't has heavy as it looks. Sukiyaki udon was pretty standard.Overall I would give a 4 star rating, it's hard not to compare with other udon restaurants in the area.. just a little overpriced."", ""Great quality food for Boston standards! This is a VERY popular place, make sure you plan ahead before coming here. If you come later in the evening on a Friday or Saturday, there is a good chance that they will tell you that they are full for the evening. You can't make reservations; you have to write your name on the sign-up sheet, and although you leave your number on the sign-up sheet, they WILL NOT call your number. They told us that the number was only for contact tracing. They will come out the door and call your name if it's your turn. So make sure you stay there and wait in person.The udons are simple and delicious. The noodles are very chewy, the broths I've had are generally pretty tasty, and the portions are great. The shrimp tempura was very special, because it was more like a little pancake with a mix of veggies and a few small shrimps. The prices are a little steep however, but to be expected for Boston I suppose. Would definitely come back to try other udons on a weekday!"", 'Such a good reason to wait outside when on wait-list. I ordered the Uni Udon. And it was such creamy goodness. There is a lot to choose from like suki yaki and curry chicken Next time, I will be sure to try these. Great place for the colder season.', 'I think I ordered the wrong udon. It was a pretty subpar experience, having the Ebi kakiage (shrimp & veggie tempura) udon off the lunch menu ($15-16 cheaper than the other part of the menu). \xa0Maybe since it was served in a more ""traditional"" sense, with a soy sauce based broth very bare, minimalist presentation. I should\'ve looked at the menu and photos before ordering, cuz I would\'ve gotten something else. My friend got the pork kimchi and I tried some of the broth, wow that was flavorful. Almost like a kimchi jjigae stewed richness. Mine on the other hand was basic... The noodles also were sparse, making it look like I had a ton of soup to slurp, and the tempura was not like what I was envisioning. I was thinking of a nice mound of tempura on top of my noodles: long single shrimp pieces and large chunks of veggies like sweet potato, broccoli, etc. But to my surprise, I was served three medium clamshell-sized dollops of tempura that consisted of thinly sliced veggies (hard to tell what kind) in a tempura batter base and then two little baby shrimp pieces on top of each dollop. Don\'t be like me and get yourself a signature udon dish that stands out. I think it was a nice dining experience indoors though, had a lot of open air seating though we were faced with a wait when we arrived.']",positive

I went to the counter placed my order,payed and shortly there after my food arrived. The place is a Ala carte type place. However very reasonably price. My meal was $12.66 and that was with a drink. That is almost a unheard of price for food these days. The portion size was amazing as well for the price. Turkey meatloaf..a very large portion,moist,flavorful ,not dried out.Collard greens ...yea probably cooked by someone's crooked eyed granny. Mac n cheese. Ok it wasn't bad.

They aren't open as many hours as they used to be, this is also not a deal breaker but it makes it tough for me to go there at lunch now. They went up on the prices, also no big deal The biggest change is that they don't offer their full menu every day or any day for that matter. I used to go in and order any type of pasta, with any type of sauce and toppings and that's no longer an option. They now have certain pastas and certain sauces on specific days and I don't like any of the combinations that they offer. Yes I can still get a meat and vegetables which I love but it's just not the same as it used to be. Bring back the full menu all the time."", ""Eats is a traditional Atlanta style restaurant. I'm surprised it was my first time coming here. The value of the food is great considering so many restaurants in this area are starting to become so pricey. They're known for their meat + 2 sides. We got the jerk tilapia (only served Fridays), the lemon pepper chicken, collareds, mac n cheese and black eyed peas. The chicken was awesome.

The nyama choma is basically a grilled meats platter. \xa0From what I can tell it's beef shortrib, beef or lamb skewer and grilled chicken. Of the three, my favourite was by far the short ribs. They were deliciously fatty, marinated to perfection and so plentiful. My plate was literally a pile of meat (along with masala potatoes). The skewers had a fantastic rub on them that managed to keep the moisture in and coat your whole mouth with flavour as you ate.

We visited early one February morning for breakfast... something that they are supposedly well known for.Walking into this somewhat spacious dining establishment, you realize that this is more like a full-scale restaurant instead of a tiny cafe. The menu offering is highly eclectic with a mix of western, Indian, and East African dishes. As we arrived when they first opened, the sounds of what I presume was morning prayers (Ismaili perhaps given the close proximity of an Ismaili community centre?) punctuated the restaurant, followed up shortly thereafter with light jazz music.I opted for the Brunch Special ($15.95) which consisted of a veggie omelette with masala potatoes, kheema (ground beef) curry, bharazi (pigeon peas in coconut curry), and puri (a fried Indian flatbread that's light and airy). Let me tell you... there's a lot of food in this dish! Loved the kheema curry but I found the bharazi to be a bit too watery.They also serve a traditional English Breakfast ($14.95) with baked beans, sausages, bacon, eggs, potatoes, and toast. Talk about hearty! The standout here has to be those thick, plump, juicy sausages which had a nice crackling to the bite. I would definitely come back just to have those sausages again.If you're in the mood for a mix of western/Indian/East African dishes, James Street Cafe has you covered.""]",negative
"['Superb experience! The bread basket was a gem. Would go there for this alone. Had the Pacific oysters - marvellous loved the fact each oyster was cut into two pieces. Every mouthful delicious. Foie Gras divine. Duck breast was delicious and as tender as any Bavette steak I have ever had. Outstanding. Desert - had the Orange. Passion fruit. Guava. Best desert in my entire life. Overall loved the attention to detail such as serving hot plates. Service was excellent. Do not live in Vancouver so was last at this restaurant 10 years ago and was so impressed then. It lived up to my expectations I remembered from then. In spite of age this restaurant is fresh and up to date. Service from the moment you enter to when you leave is an impeccable experience.

Next an amazing trio of pupu (canapés), 1st- dig deep to the caviar and beet root, wow all kinds of texture from crunch to smooth to the best kind of salty - ah caviar. 2nd the tempura shizo leaf held tartar topped with ahi sashimi, yum. 3rd sashimi scallops in a citrus broth ho, so good. Moving on to the oyster, which must be a signature dish as we spotted a plate full on next table, wow, sprinkled with truffles oh so yummy. The halibut and shrimp was wrapped in Swiss chard (almost like nori) with fresh veggies in a savory foam sauce, talk about melt in your mouth. The duck breast and duck sausage was so delicious with a beautiful brown sauce. Ahh the lamb rack was perfectly prepared. So full and happy. And yes 3 desserts. The last one looked like the floor! \xa0This menu had so many of my favorite things from caviar and beets to truffles to savory foam to duck and lamb wow I'm so happy and will definitely return.

The steak diane is also our favourite with the bone marrow sauce which melts in your mouth . There's also this super creamy broccoli puree which paired with the steak and was so so delicious. Who knew broccoli can taste this good! \xa0The sablefish was very flavourful and cooked perfectly. I really liked their crab turnover, very cute and delicious!"", ""L'Abbatoir is my favorite restaurant in the world because the food, service, and atmosphere are so unique and wonderfully executed that it makes a second to none dining experience.1/ The food is absolutely fantastic - the dishes are incredibly inventive - they serve food you really cannot find anywhere else that's unique to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest of Canada - and the execution is 150% on point. Just about everything they serve here - from the excellent baked shellfish dish to the Steak Diane to the drinks - is memorable in the best way possible.2/ Service is top notch, comparable to 3 Michelin star places minus the pretentiousness. They change plates and silverware after every course and dust crumbs off the tablecloth the same way they do it at Jean Georges, etc. The servers were super friendly, attentive and bend over backwards to make you feel like royalty, but in an unobtrusive way. All the staff here are also super down to earth.3/ Atmosphere is wonderful - the restaurant is located in Gastown which is charmingly lit up in the evenings and the interior is really beautiful, elegant, but in a hip and chill way. Last but not least I found everything here to be super affordably priced given what you're paying for, and it certainly helps if you're visiting from the US (FX)!"", ""Can you say AMAZING bread? Holy, the bread at L'Abbatoir is off the charts good! I could eat it forever (sorry to my celiac friends)But it doesn't stop there, with great cocktails, the best steak I've had in a really long time, oysters - yum! Everything was really good, but the bread is to die for!"", ""We went to L'Abattoir for dinner last Friday night to celebrate our first two months of marriage (because why not) and because my husband had still not yet been to this Gastown gem despite all of our foodie adventures.If you're looking to mark a special occasion, note that you'll definitely want to make a reservation at least 2 weeks in advance - even during the pandemic! My hubby made the reservation and was shocked that finding a table would be so difficult, but I assured him it was worth it.It's the perfect venue for an intimate, cozy, and fun dinner whether it's date night, a night out with friends or coworkers, or showing visitors the best of the Vancouver restaurant scene.We were seated in the back space which is a glass enclosure facing the inner courtyard of Gaoler's Mews, complete with twinkle lights and exposed brick walls.Andrew was our server for the evening and provided impeccable service from start to finish - extremely knowledgable, attentive, and welcoming without being intrusive. We were extra lucky as he's also (one of?) the sommeliers, so he was able to give us suggestions on wine pairings based on other wines we liked and what we were planning to eat. He was a joy.On to the food!We started with a round of the Paper Seaplane cocktails (Woods amaro, Boulard calvados, Cocchi americano rosa, tart orange, avocado pit and oat orgeat, bitters), which we both loved. It was woods-y, and citrus-y goodness without being too sweet despite the calvados. We then ordered the starter of pan-fried veal sweetbreads on toast (pickled shallots, sauce gribiche with veal tongue in it) - it was delicious and the presentation was beautiful (really). As the name indicates, it's one piece of toast fully loaded which made sharing a little difficult if you're hoping to preserve the presentation. Regardless, it was excellent. If you're a fan of sweetbreads (or have just been curious about 'em), I would recommend starting here. It smelled amazing and so we dove in immediately, and forgot to snap a photo before we were half-way through the toast (not so beautiful) but it's a popular dish so check out the other photos for reference.Their famous bread basket was also delivered to the table and included 3 different types of carb-y goodness, including a cheese and bacon roll; a sardine twist pastry, and a homemade cracker loaded with seeds and spices. The twist and cracker were our faves.For our next starter, we ordered the chilled marinated octopus (saffron emulsion, chili, crispy potato) and it was the food highlight of the evening for me. Again, the presentation was well executed and all of the flavours and textures worked perfectly together (see photo).It was then time to move on to wine so in perusing the list and bouncing some ideas with Andrew, we opted for a French Malbec (can't resist teasing our Argentinian friends). We had the Château Les Croisille '19 Malbec which was pleasant - \xa0juicy fresh raspberry, pomegranate and blackberry fruit with a smooth and supple finish. Easy to drink, though not particularly interesting or memorable.For our main, we shared the Thiessen Farm quail with smoked and grilled foie gras (stone fruit, Tokyo turnips, escarole). Once again, the presentation was gorgeous (see photo) and the flavours were bang on - the little parcels of foie gras were divine and melted in your mouth. This was my husband's food highlight of the evening. The quail was succulent and paired perfectly with the bright fruit flavours.Ultimately, we were too full for dessert but Andrew surprised us with a celebratory glass of bubbly each to help mark the occasion. A perfect end to a perfect evening - thank you to Andrew and the entire L'Abattoir team for making the evening so special for us! We can't 'til our next visit."", 'Outstanding evening. Service was exceptional, food was amazing and the sommelier chose wonderful wines', 'Warm welcome. Great service throughout. Food was flavourful and well timed.

But this review is for the One Taco off Anderson Lane Location.I think you all need to check the cheese that you serve with the chips n queso and or the nachos at the Anderson Lane location. I have ordered it a few times and it tastes like spoiled milk. The cashiers are not the friendliest and the quality has gone down over the years. On a positive note, the tortillas are always fresh and the Latin music variety is fun, but sometimes the volume is too loud. *This review is to provide feedback in hopes that your business will benefit from an honest customer presenting this information.', ""I was genuinely impressed by One Taco! I had my reservations considering it was a stand alone restaurant off the highway, but it was a hit!I ordered one chicken and one beef taco and each went for around $4 or $5. Both tacos were hot and fresh with incredible taste. They were topped with a burnt cheese (hear me out on this one) that sealed the deal. The servings were also larger than expected and left me full for the evening. The staff also stood out to me. I had never been to this location before so I'm sure I looked out of place trying to read the menu, but the cashier was very friendly and answered all my questions. My food came out in less than 5 minutes, so a perfect stop when you're in a rush.There were a few tables inside but the majority of seating was outdoor picnic style. This would be a cute lunch spot on a sunny day. The tables were fairly close together so it felt somewhat communal- I didn't feel awkward eating alone at all!I'll definitely be returning to One Taco to try their breakfast tacos. Exceeded my expectations!"", ""Honestly, not good.I drove 30 minutes because an Austin food blogger posted something about this being her favorite on her Instagram story. Later, a story was posted that says she was asked to come film - so this had to be sponsored because out of ALL of the taco options in ATX this her fav place?! Not a chance. I ordered what she recommended: al pastor taquizas and a steak taco. Dry. Dry. Dry. Is the best way to describe both. The only thing that was tasty were the two hot sauces (the green is HOT, fyi). The al pastor had very little flavor - which, in my experience, is a first for this kind of taco. The steak was the same and really just tasted like the corn tortilla and the little bit of bacon that was in the taco. In addition, the cashier wasn't wearing a mask. One of the cooks was wearing his below his nose with part of his mouth exposed, and I witnessed (who I assume was the manager) pick his nose then prepare himself some food (touching everything you touch to make customers' food) then walk around behind the counter and grills eating his food, talking, etc. Probably won't be something I'll try again and definitely wouldn't recommend."", ""TLDR: Okay, I'm a fan. If you're in the area, this is a great sit-down spot for tacos.Finally stopped in to try this place after passing by it multiple times, and having a great experience at their place on Anderson. \xa0I even like the atmosphere, with the metal tables, cheery teal backgrounds, and Mexican music. The Al Pastor taco is excellent here - marinated pork sliced off the rotating grill, paired with onion, cilantro, and pineapple. \xa0I personally like the 'Gringa', which is the Al Pastor served on a flour tortilla and with a dash of cheese.The Pollo Asado comes with chicken, cheese, and a great sauce. \xa0I asked for it with avocado and was blown away. And my hat's off to one of the best versions of Mexican street tacos I've had (Taquiza de Asada) which are 5 mini corn tortillas with tiny cubes of steak, onion, and lots of fresh cilantro. Pair this with fast, friendly service and a decent price, and what's there not to like? \xa0This place gets a total recommendation from me.Pro Tip 1: Show up on Tuesdays for the $2 special on tacos al pastor!Pro Tip 2: Try your tacos with a dollop of the green tomatillo sauce or the even better creamy avocado sauce. The red sauce to my taste is a little weaker and not as tasty.This place scores a 5 out of 5 on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing away after finishing a plate here.4 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK having a nosh here with Mother Mary.3 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Joseph good. Would be OK having a beer here with Jesus' Dad.2 out of 5 stars: Come-to-the-Apostles good. Meh. Wouldn't have my last supper here.1 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Nobody good.

Wasn't the biggest fan of the El jefe taco but the egg was nicely cooked to where it created a really nice sauce for the rest of the taco.

This one was definitely not a top contender for me."", ""Don't ask for over hard egg and extra steak on breakfast tacos. The chef makes it how he wants.

"[""Came on recommendation from a friend, who says this is one of her favorite spots in Boston. I totally see why after visiting. Nice ambiance and a very extensive menu of delicious tapas and wines.So many vegetarian options I was overwhelmed. We ended up splitting sweet potato hummus, brussel sprouts, and homemade ricotta. All were good, but don't get me started on that ricotta. It's the stuff of dreams. Perfect texture and flavor alike.Also grabbed a glass of red. It happened to be one of the cheapest on the menu but didn't taste like it as it was super smooth and tasted great. Would love to try more of their awesome selection of mostly spanish-centric wines.Value was very good. I don't recall exactly how much we paid but it was very reasonable for the quality of the food, and I remember being surprised it didn't cost more. Would totally come back here if in Boston again!"", ""Fun and lively ambience and good drinks but nothing much more. Came in on a Saturday night with reservations for 4:45. Our table of three was seated promptly and we put an order in for the pitcher of white sangria. Highly recommend the drink- refreshing and sweet with slight hints of lychee flavor although that's not listed anywhere on the menu lol. We ordered the ham and cheese croquets, bacon wrapped dates, and a half size of the paella mariscos. I have to say all three dishes felt a bit disappointing. I know tapas are supposed to be small plates but jeez these portions were real small. $2 for a croquet ball that was less than impressive and same with the bacon wrapped dates. Im not a fan of goat cheese and that's what tasted like as the sauce with them. The paella portion was extremely small (I know we ordered the half size but still) and most of the rice was burnt. Maybe that's a thing with paella? In any case, I'd consider skipping next time.Overall, would come in but sit at the bar for just a sangria next time around!"", ""Man this place is busy!

I ordered the boquerones (vinegar anchovies in olive oil) , potato omelet (which they call tortilla here) , croquettes and the truffle bikini ( grilled ham and cheese).

The fried potatoes were served on a medium spicy salsa and were topped with a garlic aioli. \xa0It was a very good combination and the potatoes were nice and crispy. This was probably my favorite or second favorite dish.Arugula Salad - A nice refreshing salad to follow the fried potatoes. \xa0The arugula was topped with pomegranate seeds, feta, and quinoa.Cauliflower Confit - This baked cauliflower was topped with aged mahon cheese and breadcrumbs. \xa0It was still very good, but probably my least favorite dish we had.Grilled Broccolini - We could smell this as they brought it over to the table, and the smell was incredible! Broccolini isn't my favorite food, but it was a great preparation that I would definitely recommend to anyone!Squid Ink Fideos - We ordered the half sized portion of this dish and it was really big (I can't imagine how big the double order would be!). \xa0This is the dish that is competing with the patatas bravas for my favorite. \xa0It was very flavorful and the calamari was very tender (also anything with garlic aioli is good!). While the squid ink may be off putting to some, I would totally recommend giving this a try. \xa0I also think this is something good to share, and may be a bit too much for one person (the half size was the perfect size for two).Overall, I was very happy with the food at Barcelona especially given that the restaurant is a chain. \xa0The service was a bit slow at first, but was good once the meal got going. I would definitely recommend you check out Barcelona as the food is really good and very reasonably priced."", 'Me and my mom came in on a Thursday night with no reservation.

We had dinner reservations for 9:30pm and was seated right away when we arrived (it was a full house). Some places have you wait an extra 10-15 minutes which is always a mood killer.

Very nice and attentive.This is probably our third time here at Barcelona . My wife already knows what she wants so we immediately ordered the squid ink pasta. (TIP- large entrees should be ordered right away because it usually takes 40-45 mins to prepare).Moving forward , we ordered probably 10 more dishes LOL we thought we over ordered but realistically, we didn't because these are small tapas which I love so much because I can taste and enjoy a lot of things on their menu.We started off with the east coast oysters. It was so amazing! LOL it was so refreshing and the vinaigrette sauce they put on top was amazing. Then we ordered sear scallops, steak with truffle sauce, duck breast, mussels , croquettes with their truffle sauce, pork belly (super tender and tasty!), beef tartare and some ham and cheese sliders which were amazing...Overall, everything was so flavorful and satisfying.

Their recommendation is 2 small plates per person, which comes to ~$20 after tax/tip, before drinks. In addition to the South End location, there is also a BWB in Brookline (and a dozen more across the country), but the environment doesn't feel like a chain at all.

I love tapas in general and these were all super authentic and tasted delicious. My favorites of the night included the Chorizo with Sweet and Sour Figs, Grilled Hanger Steak, and Brussel sprouts. Honestly, I could have eaten the entire bowl of the chorizo, it was that good. The sweetness of the figs balanced the spice of the chorizo perfectly and there was a tasty thick sauce. The brussel sprouts were fried really well and we loved the addition of the picked onions. The steak was cooked perfectly and the truffle sauce on top was yummy. We also enjoyed the charred broccolini and halibut - both had great sauces and the halibut was cooked very nicely . I'd probably pass on the empanadas, as they were a little sweet for our preference. Perhaps my favorite part of the meal, though, was dessert. I can't decide if I like the olive oil cake or the chocolate lava cake better, both were amazing (olive oil cake was a bit more savory, chocolate was richer and sweeter), but I still think about the olive oil cake so that might be my favorite. The bread was also delicious. I would 100% recommend stopping by, the food is delicious, atmosphere is great, and the staff is friendly!""]",positive

The fried black garlic is definitely a culprit but I think they\'re holding out on a secret ingredient in the menu.The Fingerling Bravas, Sichuan Cucumbers, Cheezus, Pigs in a Blanket, Vegan Ramen (very tasty even w/ Tofu) and the Chashu Don (pork belly rice bowl).There is a list of \'Add ons\' on the menu to enhance your flavor profile on your Ramen dishes.The drinks are nicely crafted and change during the seasons. My usual drinks are the Smoked Old Fashioned or Toki Old Fashioned made w/ Japanese whiskey.The atmosphere here is awesome b/c you will hear one of your favorite 90\'s old school hip hop tunes and if you\'re sitting at the bar will probably make a friend. Our favorite bartender Brantley ( I hope I spelled his name right) is super cool, knowledgeable in drink making and always brings fun conversation when you\'re sitting at the bar. I adore this place and continue to bring my friends and family when they come in to town. It\'s an obligation b/c not every city has incredible Ramen and appetizers like DOMU. I hear the Fried Wings are ""KFC"" epic and have won awards here in the city. I don\'t eat chicken but if you\'re a chicken lover, go for it!NOTE- This restaurant is walk in only. No reservations. There is plenty of parking in the plaza. You may have to wait an hour or so depending on what day/time you arrive at \xa0DOMU but please be patient. They are worth every penny and moment you wait. Cheers!', ""My husband and I were dying to come here because of all the good things we've heard about domu. The restaurant was in no means bad in anyway, I just thought that everything was very bland.We originally came here for the ramen but after appetizers we got pretty full. We ordered the seasonal wings, DOMU wings, bravas, and cheezus. The seasonal wings were not good. They smelt like fish and tasted like fish. We offered them to the table next to us and they tried it and also didn't like it. The DOMU wings were much better and we enjoyed those. It was the same fry batter which is super crunchy and delicious. I would recommend these. The Baravas were super insanely bland and I ended up asking our waitress for salt and all they had were salt and pepper packets but they did the job. The cheezuz was also bland and needed a little salt on top or on the corn. But it was delicious nonetheless. I think all in all this place is way too small and even though we were there before it opened and were only a party of two, it still took over half an hour to be seated. There's nothing that I tried that I feel like I would return for. Maybe you will enjoy it, I just did not."", ""I really like this place. The decor is awesome, I've never had anything but great service, and all my friend tell me their wings are the best ever. Here's my thing- you can't customize your ramen, which is kinda rough for my picky, vegetarian self. I ordered the one with buttered miso broth, added tofu, then got the pork belly on the side for my friend. It's all good, a bit salty for me, but I enjoyed it. It's kinda annoying I couldn't just switch the pork belly for the tofu, but I get it. People can get crazy with substitutions, so I'm sure it's easier to just say no substitutions. Their soft serve is where they shine though! I love how the flavor is always changing, it was horchata flavor when I went, topped with Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal. Too good! No matter how full you are, at least get a sample of the soft serve, they're always tasty!"", 'We were in town for vacation, and so glad that we got to try DOMU out! Ramen was good, and everyone there was super nice and attentive.', 'Was craving Ramen while at a conference in Florida. Located in the heart of a busy shopping complex, this restaurant has great curb appeal. With a combination of outdoor seating and indoor, this place was very busy for a weekday. No reservations (we waited 45 min for a group of 2 but buzzers were given so you can walk around) but well worth the wait. The ramen is very well balanced and the broth was very flavorful. The egg was to die for. It was perfectly done. Great soup spoons and the portion sizes were very generous. We also grabbed drinks while here. I recommend the Lychee Martini if you enjoy Lycee. 10/10', ""First thought to myself when I found DOMU on the my bookmark list - why would I come from LA to Orlando to have ramen/Japanese food? Well, my dinner here gave me plenty of reasons of why that is. My coworker and I came here on a Monday night, and this place was jam packed. We managed to find ourselves 2 bar seats and were glad to be able to order a full meal from the bar tops. I had ordered the New Japanese Mazemen, and shared the Domu wings with my coworker. My oh my, the new Japanese Mazemen was SO RICH, but it was at the same time SO YUMMY!! The mazemen had very good charred mushroom flavor, along with shreds of chasu pork. The sauce was very rich and flavorful, and I could barely eat half of it. The Domu Wings were also the star of the show, it was perfectly crispy and picked up all the sauce. My goodness, I love that this place was so hip, modern, and welcoming to all people to experience the Japanese flavors with a modern/fusion twist. The food was authentic, with bold flavors that didn't overpower the authenticity. I am waiting for the day I come back to Domu to have another bowl of their mazemen!""]",positive

Will definitely be back."", ""Most overrated restaurant in Austin. If you are reading this in time for your next visit, please save you money and take it somewhere else.

We were told to order all the food at once and that they would course out the meals. They served our apps AFTER the main course.

I had the chefs choice omakase (10 course meal) and the experience is literally something you have to try yourself to understand. This was my first fine dining experience and I was worried that my unrefined palate wouldn't be able to appreciate it but the gap is so wide that my little brain was blown. The technical things first: very classy staff - we had 3 people wanting to try omakase but it's usually only made for two. They adjusted and we were able to enjoy it together, price not inflated. Swooped in silently to refill the water even though I could've easily done it myself because the jug was on the table. Helped us take pictures at the end, could tell they had extensive experience doing so and patience. We had a late reservation at 9:45 pm but they don't close until the last customer leaves. One of them shared joyfully about how much they loved their job and why Uchiko was different from the rest of the places they've worked at. And now for the food: I will describe them as a whole because I would never be able to repeat what those servers were rapping at me and I've never even heard of most of these ingredients, but I think the experience is more about the quality of ingredients you don't have the resources to acquire or the ingenuity to think of novel combinations yourself. Very cool, very worth breaking vegetarianism for.Tips: don't get omakase with people who do not get omakase, eat before if you have a bigger appetite but poor college student cuz it's still good to check out what fine dining feels like, ask for a spoon from the beginning"", ""Super upscale restaurant that's perfect for many different occasions. Came here with a 9:45pm reservation and was seated right away. We had 3 people in our group wanting to do the omakase and our waiter accommodated them and allowed a 3-person omakase rather than a 2-person one. I got the soft shell crab ($15.50) and unagi ($3.50) as my main courses. I couldn't really taste the crab itself, if anything, I just tasted the fried part. Nonetheless, it was still delicious and was good with the sweet sauce. The unagi was delicious as well- the eel tasted fresh. For desserts, my friend and I split the jasmine cream and milk and cereal (both $10). The jasmine cream was one of the most unique desserts I've ever had. It's a layered dessert with crust as the bottom and a cilantro flavor but it somehow worked well together. The milk and cereal was my favorite. The fried milk was the best part followed by the toasted milk ice cream. Highly recommend getting their desserts. We really enjoyed our time dining.

The seating was limited, so coming before the lunch rush was best and also due to social distancing. As restaurants opened up indoor dining, we tried that as well, just to compare. Between the two I prefer the outdoor seating.The ordering and payment varied. Outdoor seating: order and pay at the podium they provided outside before seating yourselves.

I truly appreciated all of the options, especially for the prices. I got a 1/4 roasted chicken, sweet and spicy chicken, vegetable fried rice, and plantains. I basically got two meals for $9. I'm eating the rice and sweet and spicy chicken for lunch and the roasted chicken and plaintains for dinner. The meats and plaintains were delicious. The rice, even with added soy sauce, was very bland. But that's ok because the super flavorful sweet and spicy chicken balanced it out when I ate them together. The last time I came here, I got the chopped grilled chicken, macaroni and cheese, and the lo mein (noodles). The chicken was amazing and the macaroni and lo mein was decent. I haven't found their best starch yet, but they have so many options. They literally have everything from spring rolls and cornbread muffins to fried okra and candy yams (sweet potatoes)."", 'Yes yes yes!!!!! These people know how to make neatly and delicious food.

The restaurant itself is very clean, put-together and overall just nice. (They even have the fancy material napkins folded all nice, lol.)First time we went, we were slightly put off by the lack of customers (there was only one other man there), but by the end we were shaking our heads as to why it wasn't packed! It's most likely fairly new. I am a vegetarian and was highly impressed with their selection and their tofu is great. I got the Muttar Paneer and it was AMAZING. Not too spicy, but still had a slight kick to it. I ordered the same thing both times because I was so impressed and the second time it was a bit spicier than the first time. So if you are sensitive to spicy foods, not to worry, they do cook their food quite mild usually, but just in case, give him a head's up and you're definitely going to be impressed.

The Elephant Ear was ready in a nano second, which should have been a warning, ""Not made fresh."" Sure enough, it wasn\'t! An Elephand Ear is basically fried dough with butter, cinnamon and sugar. They are served hot out of the frier, the dough is chewy, and you pull off pieces to eat and share. This dough was ice cold and crispy. Like when you get cinnamon crisps at a Mexican restaurant. Crunchy and cold. Terrible. We thought about returning it and asking for the beignets in exchange, but were so disappointed that we tossed it in the garbage and went on our way. In retrospect, I should have checked in on Yelp, gotten the free beignets and skipped the Elephant Ear!

Light breaded and a little spice. Also had curly frys and pepper rings (like onion rings but with peppers). These were very good. It's a food cart with an area to sit and eat.

At any rate, I ventured to this Davie Street BEC store, hoping to purchase a few cases of my fave varieties and perhaps try a few new flavors, as they have a huge selection online, and they cost $3.09/bar (a WAY better deal than the price per bar in other Vancouver stores I've researched).

There were very few Quest bars available when I found where they were located, so I asked an employee if there were more in the back, or any cases.

She said I should check the Robson Street store to see if there were more Quest bars there.I was surprised that the supply of a product available in droves on their website was, for all intents and purposes, not available in their brick-and-mortar store, and I was also surprised that staff told me to check another store instead of going that extra step of calling the other store to check inventory for me. (Most other stores, in my experience, would take it upon themselves to do this, rather then advise a customer to go other sites and take their chances that the product/s they want are in stock there).

They also have outdoor seating, but we were there in the middle of November, so of course that part was closed.Service was great and friendly on both visits. The two waitresses we interacted with were helpful and knowledgeable, and eager to answer our questions about the beers on tap and my initial request to build my own flight.On our first night, I ordered the Grilled Cheese sandwich, and opted for the roasted red pepper bisque that came standard with the meal ($14.50). My husband ordered the Pub Burger ($16.25) and opted for the side salad. With my beer flight creation and the pints my husband ordered, we were off to a good start.Look, I know it\'s difficult to ""mess up"" a grilled cheese sandwich, so I wasn\'t expecting much from the meal. I just wanted something not-too-filling and warm. The grilled cheese version Deschutes serves as a meal is not your regular sandwich. The bread was artisan and felt fancy, in the way it crisped up and in the flavor it provided. But the bisque was the star of the meal. Not only was it warm (remember, that was my number one criteria), it was flavorful and creamy, a little velvety and a tiny bit roasty. I would\'ve gotten just a bowl of that and called it a day.My husband made short work of the burger, which he said was really well put-together and tasty. And though it had the nice ""put-together"" presentation that he initially commented on, it did kind of fall apart as he was eating it. He ended up using a knife and fork to finish the burger.On our next visit, I went straight for a bowl of soup, which happened to be Cream of Mushroom ($9) and a small house salad ($7). My husband ordered the Pear and Bacon Salad ($15) and we supplemented with an order of Chicken Wings ($13.50). The wings were a bit much, given the amount of food we had. They were decent, but I wouldn\'t get them again. Neither of us expected the salad my husband ordered to be so very big. They filled that salad bowl full of greens and thick-cut bacon, which my husband enjoyed immensely. Meanwhile, I was quickly falling in love with the cream of mushroom soup. It sounds so bland, doesn\'t it? I don\'t know what they did in the creation of said soup, but it ended up with a magical smooth, earthy, creamy concoction that I polished off in no time.The beers we ordered over the two visits were also quite tasty, and we did end up with our favorites (mine was the Spun Honey and the Jubelale, my husband loved the Ludwig Von Crispy and the Altbierior Motive).', ""My friend and I were in town visiting Portland for my birthday and we had a night without a reservation so we decided to stop by Deschutes Brewery. One thing to keep in mind is that this place is huge and extremely crowded. The ambience is much like a brewery and the noise level is fairly loud due to the amount of people packed into one place. We waited about an hour to be sat on a weekend, but we were fine with that because we were on vacation. Upon being sat, the service was fairly slow which was expected but once we did get service we ordered the following:1) Pub Burger - The burger was good, met expectations for a burger. Was cooked medium and had good flavor. However, they did forget the avocado that we added.2) Garlic Fries - My favorite dish that we ordered. The fries were cooked perfectly. They were generous of the cheese on top. Came out hot and was very delicious. Highly recommend!3) House Salad - Was as expected except for they forgot to again add the [cheddar] cheese because it came without any cheese. They were very forgiving with their mistake and gave us a salad on the house, which was very nice! 4) Mac and Cheese - We were not big fans of the mac and cheese. Contrary to most other mac and cheese dishes we have tried, this dish had the consistency of soup. We did not enjoy the flavor as well. I think this type of mac and cheese is really dependent on the person and preference. Overall, with all things considered we enjoyed this restaurant. If you are new to Portland, this isn't a bad place to try if you are looking for a large selection of food and beers, and a laid back atmosphere.""]",positive
